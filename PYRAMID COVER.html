style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">rchaeological sites in Greece could be better cared for. It is said that cut backs should be</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">made; that at this moment in time emphasis should be given to the country’s present day and leave the past to its destiny. Without the past there is no future. Whoever doesn’t possess the knowledge of his heritage is doomed to have limited  awareness  of  oneself.  This  land  has  offered everything from the very beginning of our history, arts, poetry and philosophy. Indeed, if someone stops to analyze what has been created they will probably never finish. You’ll be lost in this mythical history. Sometimes you discover a paradox. From time to time with some of my colleagues we have disputes about various subjects concerning some archaeological artifacts. Lately, we have been talking a lot about the pyramids that are located within the Greek domain. A lot has been said but for some reason there has been no in-depth study; nor any academic research. It’s very strange if someone considers the severity of the subject.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">There has been great interest in the fact that in the area of Marathon there is an archaeological site that is dedicated to Isida. The myth mentions that Herodes Atticus, after a trip to Egypt, decided that he should build a pyramid in honor of the goddess. It is very interesting indeed and it has intrigued me for quite a while now. I have to find the truth though; to get funding for research or for some other excavation, in theory, is impossible. Only to think about the bureaucracy of a government department, in order for the Academy to hold a meeting, they get tired just thinking about having to deal with something new. I posed the idea to my colleague Andromache.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides’ she said ‘I believe that it’s a wonderful idea to attempt something like that. I will stand by you with all my powers’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Her support was very important to me. Without her help it could not be realized. After a lot of thought we decided to go ahead with the venture.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We put it forward as a request at the Academy’s meeting. We waited with anticipation for the decision. The night before the decision was made a strange presence came to me in my sleep. The morning I went to the Academy’s offices I had a strange feeling concerning the decision which we long awaited. Arriving, I saw the disappointment in Andromache’s face.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I see. Tell me how many were in favour and how</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">many against’, I asked her.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Fourteen were in favour and sixteen against’ she</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Okay, don’t worry, the fact that we managed to get</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so many votes in favour is an achievement in itself’ I continued saying to her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">After a while Mr. Apostolopoulos, who was a member of the Academy and the uncle of my colleague, came by.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, Aristides’ he said to me. ‘Hello, Nicolas’ I said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘For  the  first  time  the  Academy  nearly  gave permission for an excavation. For me it’s a success that the matter has even been set for discussion. Usually they mock it. They mostly act this way because they are afraid that something new might be discovered and ripple the waters. Even though I am one of the newest members of the Academy, I have seen many things happening during my life. The fact that you have got so many votes is remarkable and it will surely cause a stir. You have to know that the matter is not over yet. It might attract some publicity and this will be to your benefit’. This was what Mr. Apostolopoulos said to us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">I don’t know why he told us all this but it seems like there is an underlying promise to what he said. Andromache though reacted differently. She began to utter words that I had never heard her say before. I approached her and I tried to calm her down. All this experience had brought us closer. There was a mutual respect and I thought highly of her; but much more was present as well. Because of the work load though, I hadn’t managed to approach her; but we both knew how we felt. So, I took the first step. I hugged her. Our feelings were perplexing. She shed a tear and I kissed her. There were tears of joy and sadness. What happened was so oxymoron! It took a small tragedy to bring us together. For now we returned to our positions. From now on we would claim Isida as a couple.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The days at the University during the summer months were quiet. Winter and spring had passed since the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">day of the decision. Her uncle’s words had come true up to a point. In the Academy there was a small disturbance. Some of the newspapers got involved with our matter. However, whatever gets a lot of publicity quickly, is forgotten just as quick. The same thing happened to us. After a small personal presentation, we continued with our mortal lives… It’s the eve of august the fifteenth and the city is empty. Nothing hardly moves in Greece during these days. Most of the people are going to be at some beach or on some island so they can get away from the tiresome routine. We all live in a tiresome way whether we admit it or not. That morning I received  an  email.  It  was  someone  named  Asterios Avgerinos. It only contained a phone number. A strange email. I was curious. So I decided to call him.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good morning, could I speak to Mr. Avgerinos?’ ‘It’s me. Who’s speaking?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m Aristides Pensilis. I’ve just read the email that you sent me. It’s hard for me to understand what you want from me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘It’d be best Aristides if we could talk face to face’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course, do you want to meet at the Book Arcade</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">at five o’clock this evening?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">He agreed. I was curious to find out what this gentleman wanted. The message he had sent to me was only a few words. Tomb, Persians and Isis. Words that for someone else might not mean anything but in my case they meant everything. So I went to the meeting point without knowing who I was going to encounter. He might not even show up. Could it be just a prank? I wanted to confide in Andromache but she would probably be against it and she would probably be right. I ordered a coffee and waited. It wasn’t long before the one who invited me showed up.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening Aristides!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening Asterios! Forgive me for being so informal, but with people I know…’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you mean? I don’t know you’. ‘Don’t take any notice of me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, the three words you sent me, someone could have considered them as enigmatic; but how did you know exactly what to send me so you would catch my attention and I would find myself here with you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right. Nevermind that, let’s get down to our business’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Which is?’ I said to him.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘The pyramid of Isida in Marathon of course’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And what do you know about this matter Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Avgerinos?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘A few months ago the subject had quite some</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">publicity, right?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Correct, but what’s your interest in this particular</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">matter?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I’m here to help you Aristides’ ‘And how can you do that?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me carefully’ he told me ‘Since it was brought to my attention I searched and found some people that could help me and I, in my turn, could help you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">I continued by telling him, ‘Thank you for your interest Asterios but the matter was presented to the Academy and they rejected it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know the whole story; you don’t have to tell me but this belongs in the past. Things will take a different turn. So I have to be able to inform you regularly about what has to be done, so I’ll need your personal phone number. We’ll meet regularly. That’s all for now’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, Asterios, I’ll wait for you to call me. Until next</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">time’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That’s what he told me and left.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">It was truly a bizarre experience. I didn’t think he was joking. He wouldn’t have gone to so much trouble. I arrived home thinking about everything that had happened. I had to share it with Andromache. We began this matter together, which now seems to be growing in proportion beyond anything we could have comprehended. I would tell her when I saw her in the evening…</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We met in Plaka.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening, honey’. ‘Good evening!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">She kissed me sweetly and sat next to me. We had gone to a tavern. We ordered something light to eat since it was summer. During dinner I hardly spoke because I was preoccupied with what had happened earlier.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, from the moment we arrived you haven’t said much. All the time I’ve known you, I’ve never seen you so quiet. What’s wrong?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen, my love, what I’m about to tell you might seem a bit odd, but I want you to listen to me carefully’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, today I had a meeting with a man, Mr. Avgerinos, who promises that he can help us with the Isida’s case’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can he help us? I can’t understand since we haven’t got the approval from the Academy. It’s not possible’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I told him exactly the same thing, sweetheart. He</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">claims that he has a way to overcome these processes’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Do you think that he’s joking, honey? Do you think he  just  wants  us  to  become  the  laughing  stock  of archaeology?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Mache, I have thought of all that myself, but I don’t</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">think he would go to so much trouble to get involved with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">this issue if he wasn’t serious. Either way we’ve got nothing to lose. For now let’s keep this matter between us. Don’t say anything to your uncle. At least until the process has started. If the excavations start, then you can go ahead and tell him’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, my love, you know that I’m trustworthy’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Could something good come out from all of this? I’ll</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">wait and see what the Fates will bring’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache agreed with me as well. A few days went by. Still, this was concerning me more and more; but nothing.  Avgerinos  hadn’t  contacted  me  yet.  I  wasn’t disappointed. I had nothing to lose. However, curiosity is like a virus that eats away at you. So, I decided to go and visit the archaeological site. Of course the time when I arrived it was closed and so I was forced to observe it from the outside. I was tempted to force the lock, but for some obscure reason there were cameras that surveyed the site constantly. Six months ago this wouldn’t have been the case. I was perplexed. It seemed like the Academy was afraid of something. That’s why it had placed surveillance cameras. There was no fear of me entering, even though I wanted to a lot, but for ethical reasons I didn’t. However, the CCTV was more than enough to show me that this change was not a coincidence. Hence, I’ll wait for Mr. Avgerinos’s phone call. Arriving at the house my partner was waiting for me.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Is everything okay, my love?’ ‘Yes, Mache’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Are you sure?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I said yes. Why so inquisitive?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Aristides, lately you have been distant. It’s like you’re hiding something from me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘You know only too well that I’m not hiding anything</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from you. On the contrary, I’m being very honest. Whatever’s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happening you know about. Wherever I go and whatever I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">do, I tell you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, where were you now, Ares? Why did you leave your mobile at home? You haven’t done that before. Also, there was an unknown number calling you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me, Andromache, it happens. All of us have forgotten their mobile from time to time. I don’t want anything to come between us because there is no reason’ I said to her.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re right. Sometimes I go too far. I will settle with</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">what you told me’ she replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You don’t have to be apologetic Andromache, it’s just that all this insecurity took me by surprise’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’ll be honest with you, Ares. My uncle, for some reason, told me to be careful because you are not being candid with me!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 38pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re uncle’s words are strange. Why would he turn round and express such an opinion of me? And what did you answer him, my love?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘My reply came from my heart. I told him that you’d tell me everything and that you’re not hiding anything. I believe I gave him the correct answer’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m just having some thoughts that are confusing me and I don’t know if we should continue this matter together’ I replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know though, Aristides; we began this together and we will end it together. We are not going to take separate roads. Isida is the one that brought us together’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, Mache, but there might be dangerous situations ahead. We’re in this together!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">After the intense conversation we had, we ate under the August moon. It was a full moon. A magical night. Although something would disrupt these tranquil waters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening!’ I answered the phone.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, Aristides, it’s me Asterios Avgerinos!’ ‘Hello, Asterios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, tomorrow we have to meet. This time you should bring Andromache as well. I have to inform you both about what is going to happen. Tomorrow we’ll meet at the same place we’d met the previous time’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Okay’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We agreed. I explained everything to Andromache. She agreed to come. I tried to find some information about him, but nothing. I only found a picture on a webpage of a baby, who bore the same name. So, it remains unknown who he is and where he comes from. The veil over the mystery would remain for some time yet. At the University we had to prepare for the coming exam period. The next morning we gave our attention to the lessons and to the curriculum we had to teach during the year. The time passed quietly by getting a lot of work done and fulfilling our obligations. In the evening, just before we were ready to leave the university, Andromache’s uncle informed us that he had summoned an urgent meeting for the professors. We, however, had to find a way to avoid it because we were going to meet Mr. Avgerinos. There has never been an unscheduled meeting before. She managed to find a way to excuse our absence. She told her uncle that we had to go the gynecologist and that she couldn’t cancel the appointment. A woman can engineer many things when needed. It’s one side of their amazing nature!</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">As we arrived at the Book Arcade, a feeling of awe overcame me, as usual. Asterios was already there. He approached us and we began to walk towards Panepistimiou Ave. As we were walking, for some reason he wasn’t speaking to us, he just told us to follow him. We got close to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the area near the Acropolis, he told us that we could talk freely now.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why?’ I asked him ‘What kept us all this time from</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">expressing our thoughts?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘It could be, dear Aristides, that they might be watching us. Near the Acropolis we are safe’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can you say that with such certainty?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You can either trust me or not. This is my only</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">condition for this matter to proceed’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Alright, we will follow you in this, Mr. Avgerinos’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We sat somewhere near the sacred rock of the Acropolis.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, Andromache, from tomorrow we will begin the excavation in Marathon’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Mr. Avgerinos, could I ask you how this is feasible since we tried to get permission but it was impossible to go on with our plans’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You don’t have to worry because the permission comes directly from the president of the Greek republic. No one is going to bother us’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How is it possible to get this kind of license?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘All your questions will be answered in due time’ he</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I continued… ‘There are some bureaucratic issues</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">that must be resolved such as our positions in the University’. ‘You shouldn’t worry about that because as of</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tomorrow substitute professors will be assigned’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘How  is  this  possible,  Mr.  Avgerinos?’  Mache exclaimed. ‘My uncle, Nikos Apostolopoulos, is never going to consent to something like that’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘He will not put up a fight. You should know, Andromache,  that  whatever  we  act  upon  has  been predefined. The orders come from above. You can’t imagine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So, tomorrow I’m going to be at Marathon around eight in the morning. You should also come around this time. That’s it for now. Take care!’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">So, we went our separate ways.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We continued with Andromache to go to a tavern in Plaka. The words of this stranger would soon be proven if they had substance or if we would be made a laughing stock.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you think of all of this, Mache?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know, Ares. Asterios Avgerinos is surely an enigmatic figure. I don’t know what to tell you. If everything that he mentions is true, there is real hope for us to be able to bring to the fore this archaeological site’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, Mache. Tomorrow we set sail for a rendezvous with History or we will lose what we already have. I have a feeling that we are about to experience something very intense’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

We had woken up early because we had to prepare our equipment. I was anxious; it was a long time since I’d felt like this. I felt like a student who was going on his first excavation. I set off around seven. The way there seemed longer than usual. Maybe it was nerves or anxiety. I could see Mache next to me, she might have been silent but she definitely felt the same way. As we approached Marathon, we were overcome with awe by all the events that the ancient people had experienced at that particular site. Finally, we had arrived at our destination. We parked our car, took our tools and went to find Isida. There was no one there! The chain was padlocked. We found a spot to sit under a plane tree. The disappointment was evident in our eyes. It was just before eight in the morning. It was unthinkable for me to believe that he had deceived us. Unexpectedly he gave life to my dreams and in a second he took it all back. With both of us feeling disappointed we walked melancholically back towards our transport. A lot could have happened, but you can’t build palaces on sand. Just as I opened the car</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">door, my mobile rang.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">‘Yes?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Where are you heading, Aristides?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Hello, Mr. Avgerinos. You said that you’d be here at</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">eight’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘And I am. It’s precisely eight. Time for me is of great importance and you should know that whatever I say, I do, as you’ll find out in the near future’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We went back to the archaeological site. Outside there was a small van and equipment was being unloaded for the archaeological excavation. Asterios was there as well. The man was telling the truth all along. We reached the locked gate. He unlocked it and opened the gate to our dreams. The joy in Andromache’s face was indescribable. We immediately began to put up the tents were we were going to work from. It was something we hadn’t expected to happen. We thought that nearly everyone and everything were against us. We had to be prudent with our words throughout the whole mission. It was possible that at any given point some obstacle could appear that would alter the entire course of this excavation. So, every movement we made outside the archaeological site should be meticulous. I had a suspicion that we were being watched, so we didn’t make reports on what was happening. However, the time had come to take out our hand brushes and whisk brooms to clean the surrounding area. Asterios approached me and he said to me smiling:</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, this is where we will build our future, Aristides. You’ll see that there are many surprises awaiting us. We’ll have an interesting course together’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, and I hope, Asterios, to discover something that will make us renowned in modern History. Who knows? We might find something. We just need patience’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The first day we put up our tents. We had to go back to our offices at the University to get some maps of the area and also all the papers from the office with the research we had done. As we reached our old offices, we ran into Andromache’s uncle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, Niko, how are you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello both of you; how are you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">His behavior was ironic towards us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Surely you could have informed me about the change with regards to the University, couldn’t you? How did this come about?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘We had to take some time off for a short period, as a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">couple we need this’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: right;">‘It is a mystery how quickly replacements were found. Usually this takes around three to four months until someone comes to fill an empty position. I don’t know how you managed that. And out of curiosity, what are you going to do? Or are you just going to enjoy each other’s company?’ ‘We have been invited to take part in an excavation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It’s an opportunity to go back out into the field. It’s always nice to find something that has been buried for centuries…’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And where is the excavation, if I might ask?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘The Dutch archaeological academy invited us today. It was them who managed to find the replacements since they’re able to act quickly’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where is the excavation going to take place?’ ‘They haven’t informed us yet’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache’s uncle knew that I was lying to him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I hope our things won’t get lost because we don’t know who Asterios will send’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry Mache, I’m sure he has made the right</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">choice’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Entering our office we saw two young people sitting</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in our places. A woman and a man.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Don’t worry, your things have been collected and sorted in these boxes. They will be sent to Aristides’s house’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘We would like to ask you, for as long I and Andromache are away, if you can be fair and objective towards our students’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t you worry about anything! We have read about both of you before we even came here. Mr. Avgerinos has briefed us about exactly what we should do here’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After reassuring us we decided to leave since it was getting dark.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Strange things are happening, Aristides. Why didn’t you tell the truth to my uncle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know, there are things going on that I can’t fully comprehend. I cannot control them so I don’t know how I should react exactly. Until the picture is clear I will only trust you and Asterios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can you trust him so easily?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You have a point but it’s because of him that we have reached our dream that many others have taken away from us’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, but there’s something peculiar about him,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">you can’t deny that’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right again but he is helping us with our operations which have been meticulously calculated. Only time will be the final judge’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Indeed the scene was blurry and it was because I could not fit all the pieces of the puzzle together. At the beginning of the project my partner’s uncle was very positive about the excavation. From the moment though Asterios contacted me, his behavior changed completely. He became more enigmatic, distant and besides that, he had no reason to tell Andromache that he didn’t trust me. All will be unraveled and what is hidden will soon be revealed. Nevertheless, we decided with Andromache to take it step by step all the way, in our meetings, in our future interviews, in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">who we trusted because it was certain that this matter would get great publicity. Then again I was wrong. No one pestered us from the press, nor from any other news agency and it surprised me that the whole subject wasn’t made known. It was probably for the best this way because nobody would bother us and distract us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The scenery at the period when it was built must have been magnificent. Herod Atticus had always made great monuments. He always completed them. He never forgot to put the final touch so his name would stay intact throughout the layers of history. At one time a large pyramid or a temple must have prevailed here. But who destroyed it? Who was it that gave the order? Why don’t the people of modern Greece have the knowledge in order to appreciate the magic of the land in which they live in? Here many events have taken place which changed the course of history. Many epic tales have been written about acts of bravery. Heroism and courage was what prevented the barbarians from conquering our land. Despite this, the people of Greece want to mimic the barbarians. They don’t know how beautiful their land is and their endless history. It might sound like a cliché but it’s the truth that whichever rock you turn over some story or local myth will be hiding underneath it.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The excavation was proceeding at a satisfying rate. My instinct was telling me that we would soon make a discovery. We had to divide up the time and work so we could get things done. So, sometimes I would stay a bit longer at the excavation site so we could get the desirable result faster. Today was one of these days. Fortunately, autumn was mild for now and it allowed us to continue with our work. It had just gone dark and we had already installed the lights which allowed us to continue after nightfall. Andromache approached me looking troubled.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened and you have this look on your face? What’s wrong?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘My uncle wants to come over here to stop us</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">carrying on with the excavation’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t think he has the power to stop us. As long as Asterios is by our side we won’t have a problem. As you remember he told us that the orders come from above. So, we have to believe that we can put our plan into action’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We hadn’t finished having our conversation when</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">her uncle appeared from nowhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Stop immediately whatever it is you are doing. You are violating all the laws and ethics of the archaeological Academy’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Calm down, Nikos, I will explain everything to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I don’t want you to explain anything to me,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aristides. Leave this place and don’t ever bother my niece again. I told her that what she was doing was wrong and that you could go to prison for being here. I will protect her but I will  make  sure  that  you’ll  lose  your  license  as  an archaeologist and your place at the university’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What is your problem, uncle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t answer me back, pick up your tools and get out of here. From tomorrow I’ll be in charge of the excavation’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘From tomorrow you can do whatever you like,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Apostolopoulos. It doesn’t concern me at all’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He turned his head round.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And who are you, sir?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Let me introduce myself, Asterios Avgerinos, benefactor  and  in  charge  of  this  excavation.  Mr. Apostolopoulos, you should know that you are on private property. This place belongs to the Polikandrioti Institute’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is…’</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What are you talking about? You are absurd. This</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Please, don’t say anything else. You haven’t got</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">permission to be here’ Asterios said to him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What you are saying is unthinkable; who do you think you are?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I was stunned with her uncle’s behavior. But what came next was even more bizarre. Two men that belonged to Asterios’s personal security approached and escorted her uncle outside. They even locked the gate, leaving only me, Andromache and Asterios in the area.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry about your uncle Andromache! They are not going to hurt him, he just won’t be allowed to enter the premises, only the three of us will be present. Let’s continue with our excavation. Aristides, at what point are you with the dig?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">I was a little suspicious and I didn’t answer.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me Arisides, I will explain everything to you soon but not now. Like I said, time is of great importance now. We have to move within the time frame. So, just before you came here I came upon a spot that might have something there. Maybe there is something underneath’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios came close to me and grabbed the broom from my hands. He hit the spot, where we were standing, with force. It was hollow underneath. So, he let the broom slip from his hands and took a pickaxe and broke the wooden floor. I couldn’t believe that we had found a catacomb.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘But how did you know that it was down there?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache went down first. Sometimes she seemed more daring than me. Growing up I had learned to be more cautious with situations and people. As I descended I found a torch. I lit it. We followed Asterios, who led the way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How is it you know where we’re going? It’s like you know the place’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t ask questions Arisides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The underground passage led to a large crypt. The sight was incredible. We had found a sarcophagus. It was Isida’s. This turns all history upside down. Isida was a goddess.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Now that we found it what are we going to do? It’s the discovery of the century. We must take it to the lab, where the conditions are right, so we can open the sarcophagus’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am so excited. All our efforts have finally led to an important result. I cannot believe it’ Andromache exclaimed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You haven’t seen anything yet’ Asterios said jokingly as he approached the sarcophagus so he could open it.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘What are you doing? You shouldn’t.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Calm  down,  Andromache,  and  open  the sarcophagus’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was amazed by the sight. It was empty.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Great, we put in all this effort for an empty sarcophagus? I can’t believe it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘What’s this scroll?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Asterios picked it up.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Well done Andromache and Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What do you mean “well done”? We only found a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">scroll!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I’m sure it’s worth something but not as much as</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if we had found a mummy’…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">Asterios began reading the scroll. It was a plea to Zeus and Chronos. When he finished reading, something</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">inexplicable happened. Daylight filled the crypt. I could not figure out where all this light was coming from.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Follow me’ Asterios said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we reached some stairs in the passage we found a lever. Asterios pulled it and over the top of us a small opening appeared. Climbing up we were inside an ancient temple. I couldn’t comprehend it. Next to the shrine from where we had ascended, there was a statue of Deucalion.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened? Where are we?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache was dazzled. She didn’t speak. There was no mention in our files of a Founder’s temple, nor has Pausanias ever mentioned it. Undeniably it was there and what we were experiencing couldn’t be a dream. There were a lot of people around and there was an intense energy in the atmosphere. Suddenly, someone came running shouting:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘We won, Victory’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We wandered around the surrounding area.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Further away there was a temple of Artemis.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">‘How can we be here?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">For a moment I thought I was asleep, that I was in a dream. That I would wake up. However, for the first time reality surpassed Morpheus’ world.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you think of the space-time of the ancient world? I know it may seem hard for you to comprehend  but  it’s  real.  Even  though  it  overturns everything  I  know  and  believe,  it  surpasses  all  my expectations’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How did you know what we had to do, Asterios?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘All will be revealed in this journey, my friends. Together we’ll have the chance to discover but also to change the course of history for the better’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you implying, Asterios, what are we going to do?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We are going to save Greece from the enemies who either want to steal its glory or they want to destroy it because they can’t understand it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘So what? Are we going to be the guardians of the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">nation?’ purpose’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘We have to seek the ideal Greece. This is our</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘It’s very dangerous. We don’t know what could</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">happen, Asterios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Listen to me, a lot could happen but we have to find the perfect moment of our nation, Aristides. The nation can exist without us’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, what you’re saying could be right but the existence of this scroll changes everything. The Founder himself wrote it, so we are obliged to defy logic and follow our feeling. Our love for our nation compels it.

style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: justify;">was still hesitant about the whole operation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 55pt;text-align: justify;">Everything would change, families, our own future. The ethical dilemmas were many. Who would prevent us from seizing power? Not that there was a chance that we would act in such a way. It could have, however, crossed our mind. The weight that lay on our shoulders, which came from the Founder’s strict orders, could not be ignored by anyone, so it left us obligated to protect Greece, as he did with his own life. And so our journey in space-time began. Asterios ordered me to pick a time in our history. So our thoughts travelled us to 480BC near Thermopiles. Somewhere near an ancient temple that was not completed. Silence, you couldn’t hear anything. We could see smoke coming from a short distance away. We went close but slowly. We heard people come towards us. Suddenly, a spear touched my neck. The one who held it told me:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Have you come to swear allegiance to us or are</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">you here to spy on us?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘We want to help the nation’ Asterios replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Which nation are you speaking of? Only Leonidas comes here with his chosen ones. Only those few will stand up against Xerxes’s tens of thousands. He didn’t learn his lesson in Marathon and wants to humiliate himself like Darius has’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The soldiers burst into laughter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Sit with us, children of Deucalion. We will share with you what little we have. In a while the king of Lacedaemonians will arrive’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The sun had almost set when we arrived. The army of the Spartan king was coming. Their marching could be heard from far away. They didn’t care that night was falling. As they came closer their adrenaline intensified. The scouts that had greeted us, at the sound of the army began talking with each other about a battle at Messenia with the Achaeans and were expressing their mania and love to protect their country’s ground.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Now the battle will be fiercer. The barbarians can’t resist us. The army of Heraclides’ descendants is the most powerful one in the whole world. We will stay in history forever as the ones who fell in battle. We will stay in the consciousness of our descendants. They will forever know that we died here. Our blood will stain the soil, the sacred soil of our ancestors. Everybody will remember us and will honour us.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I was thinking that there was no way a simple soldier would be filled with so much passion for his birthplace and also for the outcome of the battle.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Can I ask you Lacedaemonian, what is your</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">name?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Leonidas is my name’.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Are you the king?’ Asterios asked full of surprise. ‘I am just a soldier’.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘But king, should you lead your army in battle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I had to see for myself what was awaiting us. I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">don’t trust anyone else to lead. Either way I had to see with my own eyes. The king has to convey trust to the people of his town. He has to be the first in the battle, the first in everything’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">He was like the king of Myrmidons and like Alexander the Great was. We were always transcendent people.  We  always  have  to  surpass  mediocrity  that represents our age or at one time the age in which we belonged, while now we belong to time. Andromache was present but now we had to protect her. She said that she wanted to be present in the battle. She must be a Spartan to want to be present in battle. The barbarians show no mercy, they slaughter women and children.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Could you be useful?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We will help you somehow. We just have to stay behind you because we haven’t been involved in a battle before’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘You don’t have to worry. I will protect you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Just before dawn the chosen ones arrived. The put up the tents straight away and began patrolling. They were always alert in case someone tried to violate the surrounding area. The news travelled fast while the army of mercenaries arrived the next day.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The king gathered his fellow soldiers towards Hades and was explaining to them the tactics they would follow and how they would be positioned in battle. What was of great importance was the defense of the passage way that led to Atropos where they had camped. Where the battle had been lost. The night before the battle some washed and combed  their  hair,  some  of  the  Thespians  talked  to Menelaus’s  descendents,  while  others  were  practicing military exercises for the following day. Andromache didn’t want to stay hidden any longer and would rather come with us than stay alone. Her presence caused a small disturbance but Leonidas had made clear that we were his guests. It would be a great offence if someone would defy the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">unwritten law especially Xenios’s. Someone from Thespian’s military formation began shouting and causing a commotion. ‘What are the foreigners doing here? Are they</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">barbarians or have they sworn allegiance’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Calm down Thespian, don’t cuss’. ‘Quiet Spartan!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Spartans don’t take insults from inferiors’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The situation was getting out of hand. Fortunately, the calmer ones prevailed. Asterios spent a lot of time with Leonidas. The king was narrating the story of Sparta and its ancestors. Also the role of Lykourgos and the respect they had for him. Sitting next to the fire we fell asleep. A few hours later I felt a presence closing in on me and Mache. I saw that near me was Antinous, the Spartan who had stood up for us earlier. He signaled so I wouldn’t move. The seconds passed as if they were hours. My heart pounded. What  I  experienced  was  new  to  me.  Suddenly  from underneath his cape his Spartan friend, his spear, appeared and pierced the suspicious presence that was approaching in a threatening way. It was the Thespian that was provoking us earlier. Everyone around us was uneasy, as were we. For the first time we saw someone get killed in front of us. He died quickly, he didn’t manage to utter one word.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Antinous, why did you kill him?”</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Whoever provokes and does not follow the rules is dangerous in battle. There is no room for the weak here. That’s why, Aristides, have this sword close by. Hear me! Thespian, what is the name of the man that crossed Acherontas River?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Ephialtes is his name, Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">His death changed the course of history, it changed the course of the battle and it took a different turn. I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">had to find Asterios. It was like he had heard my thoughts. He soon appeared.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I believe, Aristides, that our presence here has</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">come to an end. Let’s go and see what home is like’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, no, since we are here we must see the first day of the battle’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And so that’s what happened.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">At dawn the drums were beaten. Rhythmically they marched to battle, certain that they would dine with Hades. They were wrong. Death would wait in vain. The king of Persia had sent his invincibles, his chosen soldiers. We had learnt from history that the number was always the same. Whenever someone got killed someone else took his place. With him there were riders, who did not wait as the horns sounded. The drums gave the rhythm of battle. They were sure they would dance the tango of death. The Medes and the chosen ones where “dropping like flies” and laid there. Many from the enemy were falling but none of Lycurgus’s warriors. I didn’t expect that, as it was mentioned in some of Pausanias’s scriptures, on the first day of the battle none of the three hundred had fallen. Obviously everyone thought it was a bit exaggerated but it was the absolute and only truth. That evening there was a truce, so both sides could collect their casualties, which in this case were only Persians. Through a Greek informer, as soon as Xerxes found out that none of the Greeks had lost their soul in the battle field, he was infuriated. He gave the order to double the number of those attacking. The next sunrise we decided that we had to return to our time.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We arrived at the point where we had started. I was curious to find out how our era would have evolved. We walked and there were people in uniforms everywhere. It seemed like we had been transported to an era of Sparta.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, where are we?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘In Athens. It seems like things took a wrong turn with our presence in the battle of Thermopiles. Looking around I feel that there hasn’t been any great progress in our time’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">A man in a uniform approached us.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Who are you and where are you going?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Tell me are you a Lacedaemon or an Athenian?’ ‘Don’t say that again. I should arrest you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘But why? We haven’t committed a crime’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Throughout Lacedaemonia you shouldn’t utter this word. From Ionia and Biza to Sparta no one says it. Get out of my sight or I’ll discipline you by holding you for three days. You’d better swear allegiance and let me never see you again near me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Indeed we moved away in the opposite direction. Near the old burial mound of Marathon there was a statue of Leonidas. There was a map that depicted the region of Lacedaemonia,  all  the  dominion  of  Asia  Minor, Constantinople and the Greek area. Around there where the Scythians and the Medes.  Technologically they hadn’t advanced. Obviously the main control of the area was affected by the authoritative and plain lifestyle of the Spartans. I was astonished that the Spartans had managed to prevail all these thousands of years. There was no mention of Greece.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t like how things have evolved, Aristides!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘It’s not so bad. There is security and there is one nation. Above all there is coherence and order in comparison with the freedom of chaos that exists in the time where we come from’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you saying my love? You never had</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">conservative beliefs’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know, but seeing how things have changed maybe it’s better the way it’s turned out’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, no! There is no Greece. We have to go back</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">and prevent the prevalence of the Spartans’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How is that going to happen, Asterios?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’ll tell you, Andromache, because you won’t like what you’re about to hear’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios  took  out  the  scroll  and  we  were transported again to the battle field! I had my objections. Things weren’t too bad. Sparta as a nation had managed to prevail as the greater power of the geographical area. That wasn’t that bad. The nation was safe.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The sunrise of the second day of the battle as well as the moral of the men was high. Everyone was cheering the brave actions of the King. He was fearless. We as well sat amongst the Spartans. They seemed frightened by our sudden disappearance. They thought that the Persians had killed us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, no we’re fine. We had just been hiding because Andromache had some kind of illness and we had to stay away’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where is Asterios?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">It was what I was wondering, why had he been gone for so long. So we sat with fellow soldier Antinous and Andromache talking about the outcome of the battle. Asterios didn’t show up for a while. I began to worry in case the Persians had caught him. My thoughts were disrupted by the voices of the crowd. We swiftly headed towards them. The King was dead from an arrow. At that point Asterios showed up.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Quickly, follow me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘But what happened?

Passing the point where the dead body of Leonidas was laying I shivered. The deadly arrow had pierced right through him.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He took out the scroll and chanted the prayer. ‘What happened? Tell me. Why did the King die?’ ‘So we and the generations to come can live free’. ‘How can you say that to me? Did you kill him?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course not. I found a Greek who had turned traitor. He was the perfect archer! The arrow of death saved Greece’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: right;">Even though we had returned home safe, for many days after</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">I couldn’t understand how Asterios could be the accomplice!</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">‘But we betrayed Leonidas! We’re worst than</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ephialtes’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘You have to get used to all these paradoxes</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">because they will be happening throughout our journey towards our ideal state. It is possible that worst could happen’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: justify;">Our present, had not taken a dramatic turn. We overturned the regime that had been enforced with the sword. However, my conscious could not rest. We saved the King, so we could kill him. So we could save the country. One more Greek tragedy!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><img width="72" height="20" src="data:image/png;base64,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"/></td></tr></table></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Chapter 4</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The People’s Assembly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The truth now has changed form. We came to Aristotle’s words. Everything is subjective. The variables have changed. I didn’t think that things and facts could go back to what they were. The challenge we face is great. What is it that will make us resist from changing the course of history?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Asterios, how can we find again the previous path of our lives? Is it possible to return to what we had before?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Aristides, you must know that we belong to time.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our home is in every moment’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes,  you  are  right  about  everything  you’ve mentioned. However, I want to share something with you. Maybe I’m too cautious, but who are we to manipulate history like this and control the series of events? How is that possible? Who gave us the right? The thought alone of managing to prevent or prejudge what is about to come, surpasses all my thoughts. I know now that I can’t back down but let me have my reservations for what is about to occur’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’ll  see,  Aristides,  everything  will  flow smoothly. Don’t rush to prejudge anything. Keep an open mind. You never know what we might encounter. Accept it and journey with us. Free yourself from the narrow Doric thinking’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where are we going to travel now?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">It would be a mystery. Asterios wanted us to unwind and relax from our travel. In any case our reality was different now. Our nature was different! Only to think that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">we were present at the battle of Thermopylae and we were witnesses to everything that occurred, is something not even the  most  imaginative  writer  could  have  envisaged! Andromache was more excited than me.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, you should be more positive about what we have experienced until now. Even if we don’t travel again lets think of what we have seen. No one else in the course of history has probably had the same chance as we had. Nothing we have gone through can compare, my love, to the battle in Thermopylae’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I agree with what you say, Mache, but don’t let the Furies haunt you, it was because of our orders that Leonidas died’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Maybe you’re right but I believe that we acted in such a way for a greater purpose. Isn’t that right, my love?’ Her words were full of pride. I fell asleep with the comfort of her presence.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Early the next morning Asterios woke us. It was barely light outside. We had to continue our journey! We set out again for Marathon where everything had started.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">And so, after Asterios’ decision, we ended up a short distance from the sacred rock. What I encountered was remarkable!  As  a  historic  archaeologist,  I  was  always attracted to the centre of our civilization. We found a door open and entered a small house. We changed our clothes so we wouldn’t stand out from our local countrymen.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">From a distance the view of the temple of Hephaestus could not be described with words; nor could my humble eyes conceive the grandness of all the spiritual and material creations that had occurred. Entering the agora, the centre where all the great ideas arose, you came across street traders, who sold their work. Many of these would wait for thousands of years for us to find. At every corner</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">there was someone creating something. It was unimaginable. Further along there were people engaging in discussions. There was always a subject being analyzed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">A small fraction of the society’s aristocrats where present. The views of Pericles… others would embrace him while others would say that the city is doomed to fall into the hands of the Lacedaemonians.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What is the Earth going to look like from high above, Aristophanes, you who mock everything?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know how it would be, Teacher!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Round like the Moon and the Sun. All the heavenly bodies have a spherical form. Can’t you understand that? How hard can it be?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They looked at Socrates like they couldn’t understand him. He continued by saying:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Oh, men of Athens, you still remain ignorant like</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The words of Socrates the Teacher were always wise.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I wanted to stay and hear his wise words but our purpose was different. Passing close by to where he was speaking he turned round and looked at us. It was in a friendly way like he knew who we were, but that was impossible. What could he possibly know? As we approached the Acropolis someone ran towards us shouting:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Socrates, Socrates, Alcibiades asks for you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As soon as I heard the name I knew that I had to meet him at all costs. From all the travels we’ve had and from all that are still to come, I believe that I will never again have the chance to meet such an important figure. The Teacher is the philosophical stone for all knowledge. I would find the chance to meet him, even for a brief moment. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. We agreed that we had to head towards the Acropolis. It was a unique chance for any</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">archaeologist or historian to see this masterpiece up close. As we approached the sacred rock, a large crowd was gathered there.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How strange!’ Asterios exclaimed. ‘Why?’ I asked him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘From what I know not many people gather except if it is some kind of festival. What occasion could cause such a great commotion?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Athenian, you should know that it’s the unveiling of the statue of our Guardian. Hurry!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">These were the words of an Athenian, who was excited about the event. So, with the encouragement of the young man, we headed to the Acropolis. My imagination was beginning to take over. There would be representations from all the cities, which were under the Athenian Leadership, and all the Masters of the Knowledge. We arrived at the right moment as the veil, which covered her, fell. Glaukopis, the Bright-Eyed Athena was revealed ready to defend her city. The shield and the spear were ready to defend her city from all enemies. The statue of Glaukopis was sculptured by Phidias and prevailed over the agora. I was curious to see what other things the Fates have in store for us during our stay. The crowd was speechless, as were my companions. No words could describe the spectacle. The whole technique and art of sculpture was depicted at that moment. All the spirit of the Greek intellect was harmonized with the look of its guardian. At the same time though, the people’s assembly had started an important vote. It was the right moment to be present to observe the anthropocentric democracy in action. Arriving there I began to worry about the fact that they might not allow Andromache to enter.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The crowd was large once again. We watched the representatives on the one hand cheering and on the other</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hand, condemning the speaker on the stand. It was a lively city. There were truly active citizens and not just sitting in the cafés  of  the  time,  where  everyone  that  is  deeply philosophical sits idle and judges everybody and everything, remaining in eternal darkness with himself and his circle. Time passed without any of the speakers approaching the matter in depth. The next one that was called to speak was an enigmatic figure. I had a feeling who it might be. He began with the intention to defend the military campaign in Syracuse. The navy had to sail straight away so they could protect the allies. They couldn’t have known that they would be decimated, nor could Alcibiades himself know, as he would leave his citizens to sail unaccompanied to Hades. His speech and his magnificence affected the whole city. Above all, his association with Socrates helped him greatly in affecting  a  whole  society  and  a  whole  nation  to  be condemned. All the city spoke of the amazing speech Alcibiades gave. The People’s Assembly would continue to meet for another three days even though it wasn’t common for a meeting to last so long; but the matter was important. It wasn’t easy to come to a decision. The will of the crowd, however, had been greatly affected. No one questioned how a woman was present at the agora. As noon approach the first cycle of the discussion ended, so we headed somewhere else. Andromache and I wanted to see the theatre of Dionysus. It’s hard to escape the nature of the archaeologist. Our instinct was what had brought us here. Many times logic stops and emotion prevails. Maybe this was responsible for everything. The only mystery that still remains is how Asterios found us. I shouldn’t doubt his intentions; he is here to change the course of our nation. I hope that sometime I will find the end of the thread even though it belongs to time. We just act as we are called to do. Arriving at the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">theatre the scene was amazing. A play was being prepared; but there were no spectators around. Amongst the members of the theatrical team there might also be one of the creators of a drama, a tragedy. There might be someone that was known in that era but remained unknown to us because of the different path history took! There are so many things that could have taken a different course! There was creativity everywhere, the spirit of that time flowed from every corner, no one could harness it since it finds the path of its destiny on its own. Lost in my thoughts I didn’t notice that someone had approached me.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Athenian, what’s your name?’ ‘Aristides Theodorou’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘I haven’t heard of you before’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘And you, my curious fellow man, what are you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">called?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aristides?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Menexenus of Socrates. What brings you here,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I like the theatre’ I answered him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He continued by saying that the theatre calms the soul and gives it a chance to settle.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Sit with us and cast away the Furies that haunt</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was said that nearby Asclepius used to heal, so</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the  place  was  blessed  and  had  healing  properties. Menexenus had inherited the wisdom of his father. I would have liked to have the chance to meet him but it was impossible. The Muses called Menexenus so the rehearsal could continue. The Dionysian festivals were approaching and the  theatre  was  dedicated to the  God of  wine. Andromache was watching the rehearsal all this time and had moved away from me. She wanted to go to the Columns of the Olympian Zeus. I remained at the theatre. It was my only</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">chance to watch a play even though it was only a rehearsal. Asterios had stayed behind at the Agora and was mingling with the speakers and the philosophers. He had his plan, as I had mine. Menexenus, a true actor, had the strength to act the role. He was exceptional. So many plays could have been saved! Their destruction in Alexandria was a real crime.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Foreigner, what is the reason you sit and observe</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the young actors?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">Someone had approached me again without me realizing. I said to him:</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Are you someone who wants to write or just a wanderer? Probably a wanderer of time!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Hello, stranger’ said the elder!</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘And what brings you here, wanderer?’ ‘Curiosity for this land’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘And you’re curious as well aren’t you?’ ‘Yes I am! I have a prophecy to defy’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘And what does that prophecy say?’ I asked him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Many years ago as I rode to Delphi to see the Oracle, she told me that I am the wisest of my era. However I didn’t accept this part of the prophecy. I had to prove Pythia, the Oracle, wrong.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘But,  Teacher,  these  are  Phoebus’s  words.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Shouldn’t you respect them?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I always respect Apollo’s words but it’s the weight of the prophecy that if it comes true it’ll be something that I won’t be able to handle. I have to find him who is more versatile and wiser than me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Like you, stranger, I am a wanderer as well’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you searching for, young man?’ he</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">asked me.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Teacher’ I replied ‘I am here to learn, so I can save</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">my country’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you want to save it from?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘From darkness. We need the light of Pallas Athena again’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You  should  know,  Aristides,  that  without darkness, light cannot come. Without chaos there can’t be order. Its nature’s equilibrium. Take my hand Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I did as he told me. Slowly, slowly, I began to lose consciousness. I didn’t know what had happened. He whispered that my Ichor, the blood of the Gods, would find me. It had started to go dark when I regained my senses. Mache and Asterios came close to me.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened to you? You look lost’ Asterios</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Where is Socrates? Has he left?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘What are you talking about, Aristides? Socrates</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">who? He must be at the Agora’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache came closer to me and held me.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Calm down’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am calm. It’s just that I don’t know what happened to me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I put aside the whole matter because we had to find somewhere to spend the night. Asterios had found an Athenian, who shared the same beliefs as we did about Syracuse.  The  fleet  should  not  sail.  So,  we  went  to Aristarchus’s house, the son of an Athenian aristocrat, who had been affected by Socrates’s teachings and by the democratic movement of the time. It was unbelievable how everyone managed to give emphasis to the enlightenment and the improvement of the society. Even though night was falling  there  were  still  many  discussions  taking  place. Aristarchus was in one of those gatherings and we sat to listen to him. At this period in time people were evolving for the better. The change spanned from the learning to the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">practical implementations in their lives. It would bring us all closer to the truth and we should move in that direction. He had many things to say. His words were wise. I was surprised he wasn’t involved in politics. He was a restless spirit. Everyone who studied philosophy in detail would become active members of the political ideas of the time, except for some who managed to create their own philosophical movements. Maybe even their own School of thought. Who knows? He could have done so many things and only a small fraction would reach us. So much knowledge was lost. The world could be so different! I fell asleep with these thoughts.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The next morning Asterios seemed quite worried.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He didn’t speak much.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What’s wrong, you look so deep in thought,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Asterios’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He replied by saying:</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Today is a very important day in my life. It’s like all</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">my life has been leading to this precise moment. Like the path of fate has prepared me for what will happen in the future’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My friend’, I said, ‘nothing ends and nothing begins with a single moment in a human’s existence. From that point on he will continue and proceed to the next day. It is there that you need to give your attention and should head towards. Don’t waste yourself in a moment. As you said before, we belong to time now. So carry on towards the next day and each moment that you encounter’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Our breakfast was waiting for us. We would definitely need the energy from it. A few hours later we were at the People&#39;s Assembly again. A crowd was beginning to form. Everyone who had a wish to be an active member in their society was surely present. They would listen and decide about what they&#39;d vote. These days over six thousand</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">people would attend. More than what was needed to have a quorum. All day long we had become spectators. Around noon the first break took place. The first speaker after the break was a surprise. It was Asterios. A lot of people had gathered  there.  Almost  all  the  philosophers.  All  the important men of Athens. Our friend looked determined to persuade the citizens of the city not to send their fleet and he was allowed to speak.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My  name  is  Asterios  Avgerinos,  son  of  a landowner from Acharnae. Today, I am standing before you to pose my argument in order to prevent the sail of our strongest fleet to faraway places; to Syracuse’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">His introduction caused a disturbance and they reacted quickly. Alcibiades, who was among the politicians, was trying to persuade them to take him off the stand. Even in these grim times they had to respect the speech of every speaker.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Suddenly, I reacted strangely as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes! Let him speak. Don&#39;t listen to this man it will</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">only bring destruction’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Alcibiades heard this. He had his hand under his tunic. He probably had a small knife which I&#39;m sure he wanted to use badly. I continued:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to Asterios the Acharnian, he is wise.&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">He looked at me puzzled. He didn&#39;t think that I would talk before the People&#39;s Assembly. I always had a more cautious approach to what was happening because I didn&#39;t want to intervene or change the past. My behaviour took me by surprise. I was probably carried away by the crowd that was there. Asterios continued to speak and he dazzled those who were listening to him with his speech. The scale was tipping towards us. The meeting was over and the opinions about what had to be done, were divided. Some were saying</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that Alcibiades in his speech hadn&#39;t given enough arguments to support his views. Usually he swayed the crowd but never before had someone gone against him. The circumstances were right for Asterios to manage to persuade them. When the meeting began again, Polyktitos, Pericles’ associate, took the stand. He had great influence in the politics of Athens. Almost everyone supported him. His views had found fertile ground. His words were enough to convince even the most skeptical. Later on many went up to the stand and most of them were in favour of aborting the mission. So we managed to retain the fleet at Piraeus and we didn&#39;t have to stay at that point in time any longer. We left and headed towards Aristarchus&#39;s house. We had left some of our belongings there. As we arrived many Athenians were coming to our host&#39;s house. They came for us because they wanted to know who had gone against Alcibiades. Some came to congratulate us, while others came to warn us that he might come humiliated to take revenge. We wouldn&#39;t be there. Just before dawn we intended to return to our time. I went to look for the scroll. We searched all around Aristarchus&#39;s house; but nothing. One of Aristarchus&#39;s servants informed us that Alcibiades was approaching in a threatening way. It was certainly a dangerous moment. I didn&#39;t care about my life, I was afraid about Andromache’s safety. Aristarchus with Asterios and his followers said that they would defend us and I was going to take part as well. I have to give a part of myself for my land even though it might mean that I&#39;ll never wake again. A baby was rooting through our belongings, where we had left them. It had the scroll in its hands. We explained to Aristarchus that we had found a way to leave and that he would no longer be in danger, the only thing he had to do was to stay outside the house and let Alcibiades come in and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">see for himself that we weren&#39;t there. And that was exactly what happened. We were once again back in our time.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">On the one hand, I didn&#39;t want to leave Athens as we didn’t know how it would turn out. We just hoped that we would succeed. Whatever the outcome, though, things would either stay the same or we would constantly have to intervene in time so we could close all the wounds that had been opened.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">A lot of time had passed. From the moment that the rejection of the scientific community was made known to us, to the moment we made our first travel, time seemed like it had frozen. Like nothing would be as before.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Arriving at our house we had to rest a little before we were off again. Andromache and I spent some private moments together. Asterios spent his night contemplating. It was true that sometimes he saw things differently. It was like he absorbed every moment. Just before sunrise, I sensed that something was happening in one of the rooms in the house. A bright light radiated, even though the sun was not up. Asterios was not there when I went inside, I don&#39;t know where he could have gone. He always had his secret side. I don&#39;t worry anymore because I know that he really cares about us and that he really cares about the future of our nation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">That was what reassured me. Besides that we still had to find the end of the thread.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I headed to the kitchen to pour a glass of water. The first sunrays appeared in the background. Opposite the house there was a temple. It was hard to distinguish which of the gods it was dedicated to. I didn&#39;t attempt to leave the house and I hadn&#39;t quite noticed what was going on.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Suddenly, behind me I heard a sound coming from</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios’s room. He must have left at some point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Welcome back… I don’t know where you’ve been and I won’t ask because you’ll probably tell me not to worry; but I want you to know that I have started to have suspicions. The only thing I want to know is how this house is not affected by all the events that have happened. How come no one else lives in it? What protects us?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘This house, Aristides, is protected by a time bubble. A magnetic field that the scroll itself provides so we can do what we have to without any obstacles. We have to thank the Founder for that. Let us sleep now, we will face whatever it is we have to when it’s light’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So, with Morpheus as my companion, I walked towards my room.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Just before noon we woke up.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">All around us the Athenian ideals were prevalent. The building, the people, everyone was polite.  However, surrounding us was armed order. Here and there were statues of Ares the god of war.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The  Athenian  order  was  the  one  that  had prevailed. The Athenians not having sailed for Syracuse, never lost the battle with the Spartans. The Peloponnesian war had a different outcome.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The Athenian leadership spread throughout the rest of Greece. The Mediterranean map looked totally different. Athens ended up like Sparta. All the glory that we could see was the result of the war. Most of the citizens were non Athenians that served the lords and not the people. The People’s Assembly didn’t need the whole 6000, only the lords of every ethnic group; but what needed to be done was clear. Our plan for the ideal Greece didn’t turn out as we wanted. So we returned to our house, which belonged to time-space, as we did.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We arrived at the crack of dawn at Aristarchus’ house. We had to make sure that Alcibiades and his followers had left. I had placed all my hopes that the outcome of the operation would not be negative. The torches that stood outside the house were not lit. I took it as a negative sign. I felt something mysterious touching my spine.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Who are you stranger and what do you want in the Athenian land?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I’m Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Welcome’ it was Aristarchus ‘How did you get</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">here again? What is it that brings you back?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘We have to change something. We had an unpredictable outcome, our dear host’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asterios remained silent as we returned to the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">house.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What is it that troubles you, my friend?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What troubles me is how we are going to manage</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to change things. I have in mind what Andromache told me. It was her plan that could save the situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios had engineered to send a mercenary who would take the life of that man, Alcibiades, and would supposedly act on behalf of the tyrant of Syracuse. So the army of the Athenians would have to sail.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Antimachus, I meant to ask you, what happened</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">after we left?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened was unthinkable, suddenly in front of Alcibiades, the Teacher appeared. It took us by surprise; but it was he who saved us. We were doomed’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Alcibiades will use it as an excuse and will say that it is disrespectful when someone calls for help and that God would punish the Athenians if they helped them.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Teacher always appeared when needed like</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">deus ex machina<span class="p">, he had to be there to save us. Early in the</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">morning we arrived at the port of Piraeus. Naval architecture was prominent. A small hub of industry and invention. Athens was the “mind of the city” but Piraeus was certainly the “heart of the city”. It was where the journeys to the future colonies started. The merchants always returned there with new ideas, the wind of change lingered over the city. It was there, early in the morning, where we found a non Athenian and we announced our plan. We should appear at the Agora only if the news was positive towards the outcome of the case. If it wasn’t we should put in action the plan of Asterios.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">While we waited we had the chance to wander around Piraeus. Besides the shipbuilding, a little further down fishermen lived far from the city’s commotion. There, like Greece, the course of time continued. At that ultimate moment when he gathered his fish, he would give it generously  to  the  visitor.  The  Greeks  were  always welcoming.  Besides  being  resourceful,  they  love  their country.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We weren’t sure if our plan would work. Asterios’s plan, to kill Alcibiades, was the last solution. Things shouldn’t have taken such a turn. Sometimes the last solution could be the best one.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">News  traveled  fast.  The  People’s  Assembly gathered earlier to meet. So once again wearing Athenian clothes we headed to the meeting. Fortunately, we found a carriage and we arrived before noon. There were more people than the previous day. We managed however to move around without being noticed by the surrounding crowd. Then Antimachus met us to tell us that in a minute Alcibiades would speak.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">‘Athenian men, we are obliged to help a brotherly</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">city to remain eternally free. They are under the democracy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that we’ve established! We are the ones who gave our knowledge and contributed to the spread of free thought! We have managed to implement the idea of people’s freedom! It is for this reason we are obliged to give our help to  our  Syracusian  brothers,  who  officially  sent  a representative asking us to help them so they wouldn’t see oligarchy dominate their city!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I totally agree with the respected speaker! We are obliged to act as he mentioned! It is for the city’s good! What will our children say? That we were cowards? With courage, honour and freedom of speech we managed to convey the spirit of freedom and the strength within our soul!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The crowd cheered in favour of the campaign. The words of Alcibiades and Asterios seemed to have persuaded even the most hesitant, who were against the mission.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So the local rulers ordered the fleet to prepare in order to get ready to sail as quickly as possible and therefore reveal its power. This was going to be the city’s destruction. Alcibiades left the People’s Assembly with a warm farewell to Asterios from Acharnae.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The decisions and the events happened really fast. As we returned to our time everything was like before. The present had the same decaying course it had before we left. However, the moments when the nation was called to show its strength and grandeur had remained. The result, though, was that we hadn’t succeeded again. We had to find a more realistic solution because we couldn’t continue to play with time and events in this way. We sat for a while to think how things could evolve.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios wanted to keep a distance for a few days. So Andromache and I had the chance to spend some of our time constructively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I think that I’m beginning to lose myself in this situation, Mache. I don’t know anymore what’s real and what’s not. Experiencing all these facts, knowing all these sides of our history, I think that only in a dream this could be real. Not even Morpheus could deem to send us these thoughts. It’s like we are controlling the fate of the entire existing world. In addition, the consequences of our actions have nothing to do with the area where Hellenism spread! The entire planet will be affected by our actions. I feel like we are doing something we can’t control.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The days went by with different thoughts going through my head and everything I shared with Andromache. Even so, we still had undertaken to finish a mission.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The ultimate duty had been assigned to us, to defend history and our nation’s existence.

another turn now. The classical era is just a memory. Walking in the hot desert was magical. The southern part of it was beautiful. On the horizon we saw the sun set. Having arrived at Thebes we had to find shelter. It was amazing that the outdoor market that was held in the city look so much like the ones we have today. People of different races from all over the world were there. The bizarre thing was that many of the people spoke Greek. We hadn’t come across signs of Hellenism of that time before in these southern parts of Egypt, at any archaeological excavations or in any historical accounts. At the market you could  find  from  simple  decorations  to  books  about astrological predictions for the forthcoming events. Human behavior and the needs of one’s soul remained intact throughout the centuries. The need for social gatherings, the exchange of ideas as well as people were sold and bought. The  atmosphere surrounding the  place was something unprecedented. I hadn’t come across anything similar before.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios was wandering and was mingling with the locals. He wanted to find out when the king of the Macedonians would arrive. He was going to visit the Oracle’s temple of Amun-Ra. Maybe it was here that we had the chance to change a part of history. It could be here that the long awaited change would occur, without however him having to lose his life. Mache was looking for jewelry to wear</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">during our stay here even though she knew that she could not take them back to Athens with her.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">There were many days remaining until Alexander would arrive. We had to find a way to get into the Oracle’s temple. It wouldn’t be at all easy to achieve this. Some solution, though, was bound to emerge.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Deus ex machina <span class="p">is always there! We found at the end of the market a shelter and Andromache and I sat underneath it. Asterios hadn’t showed up for quite a while. Darkness had long since come and the cold breeze of the desert brought us closer. Just before we let ourselves in Morpheus’s arms, Asterios showed up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where were you, my friend? I haven’t seen you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for hours!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the night!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Get up, I found someone who could put us up for</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We walked through alleys, behind the market where the house of a Greek merchant named Laceses was.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘We thank you, Hellenist, for your hospitality! It</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">would be really hard to find somewhere to spend the night’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We might be in the land of Pharaoh, but Xenios Zeus  follows  us  everywhere  and  his  advice  always encourages to do the right thing!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘We thank you again!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">His house was simple but it was filled with kindness and love for others. It was hard for someone to offer shelter in a foreign land. We dined even though it was late. We had a plain meal but it had Greek flavours. Laceses had olives from mainland Greece. They were delicious and a lot better quality than the contemporary ones.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I had a strange feeling. Someone or something had planted a seed of hatred or had done something that made 21<span class="s5">st</span> century Greeks hate their own nature, the nature of their</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">creativity and their offerings to humanity. The core of this idea had to be found, an idea that could alienate us as a nation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Early in the morning, I went outside to see the sunrise. Outside the house Laceses was there with his eyes closed. It was as if he was taking in the first sunrays and they were giving him some kind of energy. I had never met before someone who was so focused on the radiating sun.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Sit next to me, Aristides and focus on the energy</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the sun. Meditate…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">And it was exactly what I did. I wanted to see how the Greeks lived. Observing and living amongst them you can understand the true nature of things. So I sat next to him. It was like the sun was cleansing your aura, like it was purifying you spiritually, like it was showing you the way you had to take as a professor.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">After a while, Laceses had to go to his shop at the market. He suggested that we should meet him at noon because someone who had contacts with the Oracle’s temple would come and he could help us. I revealed to Asterios everything that Laceses told me. We agreed that we should act as suggested.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We wandered around the market for many hours. Mache was trying on different necklaces and bracelets. She was overwhelmed by the fact that we were in Egypt. When she was a freshman at University she wanted to study the country of the Nile in depth. I remember her telling me that there was something exotic about it. Even though they got lost during the course of Egypt’s history it may have a bright side to it, there is not one descendant who doesn’t honour their history. The Egyptians of the 21<span class="s5">st</span> century are very different  but  they  still  respect  and  preserve  their monuments. On the contrary, the Greeks of my time</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">disregard values and many of them don’t care about what was given to them and what they inherited from their ancestors. That attitude was what made Andromache avert from the Greek civilization. It was the main reason she didn’t have respect for it and when she decided to go on with the archaeological excavation in order to find Isida it was because she wanted it so much, she saw it as an opportunity to come in contact with Egypt. Now she’s running around the market like a young girl because she wanted to discover what life had to offer. It was like she was rediscovering life. Her behavior was justifiable. The truth was that I was enthusiastic as well. Only Asterios seemed a bit indifferent.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, don’t you like the fact that we are here? This era is very exciting. Also, this could be our last trip in time. We might not have to go back again’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, it’s because I want this to be our last trip, our moves have to be precise and methodical so we can succeed. It is important that we succeed but anything could happen in the meantime. Some things are beyond our control. In the course of time there may be many things which we do not control. There are many unpredictable factors that may occur during our plans. We are obliged to be prepared’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We began to go to Laceses’ shop to meet with the man who had access to the Oracle’s temple. Because of the awaited visit of the king of Macedonia the market had more people than usual. That was Laceses’ impression because Amersipos was always on time. On the way to the Oracle’s temple, a fellow countryman passed by his shop.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Who knows what is happening and he is late’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">There was a slight uneasiness about the outcome of our plan. However, it was the Fates that brought him to us. Almost every day he went and consulted the Oracle as he</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">was from central Greece as well. Still, he had long settled in Thebes and had close relations with the Pharaoh’s court. For this reason he was given many privileges. At the same time he had ensured his access to the Oracle’s temple. He had a high position in Thebes’ society. Laceses entrusted us with the fact that he had been captured as a prisoner in one of the raids the Persians had carried out earlier. They had sent him to the coastline of Asia Minor and he had settled there with his family. He was only young then. Amersipos on some of his travels, as a representative of the Pharaoh, saw Laceses working under the watch of a Greek. He couldn’t tolerate this sight and thus he bought his freedom for a couple of coins and he took him with him to Thebes. Even though many years had passed since then, the gratitude and the immense appreciation he had for him would be passed on to the next life as the Egyptians believed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">In the end Amersipos was true to his rendezvous with history and he sat with us at the shop. We explained the situation to him. That we had to get in the Oracle’s temple the day Alexander would come. We explained to him in short that the future of Greece was at stake and we had to be there at all costs. We didn’t have to say much as he understood the importance of our mission. He promised us that he would do whatever he could to achieve this. On his way back from the Oracle’s temple he would inform us of any developments. It would take some time but we had to endure it. The waiting could break you, even just a few hours. Our impulsiveness had to be tamed and that was what we did.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Mache and I wandered around the market again. The previous day I remembered that we had passed a small bookseller. He had some scrolls scattered around. I spent some time browsing through the scrolls, some of which were</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">written in Sanskrit, while some others were written in the ancient Egyptian language. We also found some Greek ones as well. The owner was trying to convince me to buy a few or at least one.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hellenist’ he shouted to me ‘Come, learn what your fellow countrymen are writing here in the land of the Pharaoh. I’ll give you a good deal, take these three’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t want any’ I replied ‘I’m just looking at</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">them!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He insisted, whatever I told him. It was justifiable</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">since that was his job. He approached me with more scrolls and as he came closer to me he dropped some of them on the floor. I helped him pick them up.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘No, no’ he yelled ‘let me pick them up!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Even though he was yelling, I finally helped him.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Thank you, stranger… I wanted to ask you, from</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">which part of Greece are you from?</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘From Athens…’ I answered.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Oh!’ he said excitingly ‘From the once glorious</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Athens’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I noticed a slight irony in his voice.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Now, all the known territory is under the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">protection of the son of Olypiada, who rules Egypt as well. Who knows where your King will reach!</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">These were his words as he returned to his post</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">laughing.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I decided to go back to Laceses’ shop. As I arrived,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios was pacing. Amersipos hadn’t shown up yet. Laceses was trying to reassure us that he was coming and that he wasn’t the kind of man who would not keep his word. He would bet his life on it. But time passed and our friend thought that we should come up with a different option. It was hard to find right solution. We didn’t have the required</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">time to prepare. Asterios left the shop powerless and I didn’t know where he was going. It was one of his typical disappearances.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Time passed and neither of them appeared. I sat in a corner next to Laceses. There was something in my tunic. In my pocket there was a scroll. I don’t know how it had come into my possession. The bookseller with a skillful movement must have put it there. I quickly left so I could return it to him. I arrived at the spot where he had been, but in vain. He wasn’t there. In his place there was a woman, who was making pottery. It was strange. Not a lot of time had passed since then. I couldn’t understand it. It didn’t really matter though because we had a different purpose now. A solution had to be found about the matter which had emerged.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where were you?’ everyone was asking ‘we had to find a solution to the problem and you are wandering around the market?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, I don’t like your tone! Don’t get angry.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You have to keep calm!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘He’s right, Asterios’ Andromache said ‘we are in</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">this together, let’s not forget that!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re right, I’m sorry for my behavior!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, let me inform you as well, Aristides, after many discussions with the priests of the Oracle’s temple, I managed to persuade them to give you access to enter the temple. But the priests will be present as well!’ Amersipos said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t you worry about that, I know how to gain their respect. The thing is for them to trust us, nothing else. The rest you can leave up to me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We thank you, Amersipos. Your contribution was vital for the development of the events’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The next day, early in the morning, we would go to meet with one of the priests, who was willing to help us. Leceses made us something to eat. He wanted to cook a traditional Egyptian meal. The days we were there were exhausting. We needed rest. So we headed to Laceses’ house to eat and rest. Asterios didn’t speak much during our return.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you thinking, my friend?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I have a plan in mind, but I don’t know if it will</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">work’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Everything is possible. We have walked many</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">miles together until now so don’t worry if something turns up during the day that might help you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘It will help all of us, Aristides. All this is for the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">good of everyone. For the good of the nation’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we were talking, someone was passing with his camel. He had a white beard.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, fellow countrymen! What brings you so far</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">from Greece? What breeze blew you here?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We are tradesmen. We travel around from place to place to find rare artifacts so we can sell them in Athens’ market or anywhere that we’re invited’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘That’s great. Would you offer an old man a meal?’ ‘Of course’ Laceses replied ‘Xenios’ hospitality</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">follows us everywhere. We might be in the land of the Pharaoh but we carry our traditions and ethics everywhere with us!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">While we were talking we arrived at his house and began to prepare the supper.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘You didn’t tell us, how did you end up here?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s your name?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Sofroniskos is my name! I am here on behalf of the Oracle’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Are you the priest Amersipos told us about?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, it’s me! Tell me, why do you want to meet the king of Macedonia? Do you know that he comes here for a prophecy?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We are aware of that, Sofroniskos, but he has to be given another scroll’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Great! And what’s written on it? Why do you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">want to give it to him?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘We want to warn him about something that might</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">happen’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Fine, since it’s for his own good, I’ll help you!’</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asterios seemed calmer. His eyes were shinning, it</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">was like he knew our plan was going to work. I had a feeling that this wouldn’t be final. Maybe Clotho, one of the Fates, was weaving a different story for us. Who knows?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache and I went inside our room to rest. Asterios and Sofroniskos sat and wrote the scroll that Alexandros was meant to read. They sat many hours together. Our task was hard without doubt. They continued for several hours. In the end they had the desired result. After many hours they came out the room. Sofroniskos thanked us for our hospitality, took the scroll and went home. Asterios was clearly pleased with the result so we waited for the next day to come so he could tell us what had happened. Sofroniskos’s appearance was something we had not expected. He is definitely one of the allies who is at the top of our list. Who knows he might appear in front of us again someday. The Fates are weaving a strange plot for us. We have to be more cautious. However, we can definitely see it through whatever the case. With Mache beside me, I feel stronger. We let ourselves go in Morpheus’ arms. I slept uneasily. I couldn’t distinguish what was happening, it was as if the two worlds were merging, like they would collide and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">after their union, the world would stop existing. There was an inner conflict. That was how I felt. I got up feeling uneasy.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I went out of Laceses’ house. I felt the need to gaze at the night sky. It was different; the constellations where in different positions. Sirius shone impressively that night. After a while, I sat to meditate under the starry sky. I hadn’t felt like this before. It was like I was floating. Like my soul was feeding from some kind of energy. Soon I was interrupted. Andromache approached me.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you doing at this hour? We’ve been here for some time now but I feel like you are distant. Is there something wrong? Tell me, please!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Nothing’s  happened,  you  shouldn’t  worry!</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Everything’s fine’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Ares, don’t lie to me. I know when something’s wrong. I know you a lot better than you think, years now, long before we were partners in life’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, I feel that sometimes things are happening around us that we can’t control. It’s like something is driving us. It’s like there’s a plan or some kind of path we have to follow. But I can’t see which way we should go!</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, you are right. Ares, everything is up in the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">air!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Mache, have you ever thought what is going to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happen to us? What is our position? Where do we belong? Could it be the 21<span class="s5">st</span> century? When? The past or the future?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘It’s understandable that you are having all these thoughts but you can’t solve everything now. Come back to bed and everything will fall into place’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘And which place will that be, Mache… moving endlessly in our history? I feel like I’ve lost myself in the universe. Something must be done soon’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What we’ll do, Aristides, is to fulfill our mission. When we complete our task we’ll manage to find our place within the society’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘You should know that I’m still concerned about</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">the situation. For now, I will set aside my worries’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I  may  have  remained  silent  but  certainly something more was going on that I could not fully comprehend.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">With these deep thoughts, Morpheus took me near him. The dreams might be caused by the thoughts and the concerns I had and might not mean anything more.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">There was a lot of commotion at the market during the morning. It was like the town itself was sensing the presence of King Alexander. Priests, merchants and simple residents from nearby areas had come. Everything was moving in the rhythm of the Macedonian. Asterios wanted to meet the King but we knew that if we attempted something like that we could jeopardize the mission. Our presence during the days we were there had already raised suspicion among the locals, but as always curiosity could set in motion the powers of the people which are dormant. Fortunately, our meeting with Amersipos had benefited us even though they had unknown plans for us. No one was acting in a threatening way any longer so the only thing that was left to do was to wait for Sofroniskos to come, so he could tell us what had happened. It was one of the most anxious mornings I had experienced in my life. Mache and I had felt that way on our first day of the archaeological excavation, when Asterios entered our life. When everything was changing and Asterios during our course had grown. He is more open but this has not prevented him from being more active. But now he is nervous as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The town, however, was under the energy and the rhythm of the visit, it was like all the country’s energy had gathered in that point. That moment... The moment of the prophecy. Two eagles were flying above us. It could be a sign. The time passed. The sun was setting in the east. We knew it wouldn’t be long until Sofroniskos would show up. And that’s what happened! After a while he came to inform us about Alexander’s visit.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘His face was glowing!’ the representative of the Oracle told us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">His escort was majestic. But when he entered the main room of the Oracle’s temple he knelt down like a commoner! He had absolute respect for the gods and the holly ground. He didn’t want to be any different from the rest! He humbly accepted our compliments and some directions since he was going to Babylon. The two scrolls were given to him. He set off for his next destination.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Who knew what was waiting for us in the future new Greece. On the one hand, I didn’t want to leave because I had got used to this place during these days. I had an intuition that our journey would be long. We thanked the locals and Laceses for their hospitality and we headed for our time. Who knows… maybe we would go back again to the land of the Pharaohs. We left whatever items we had accumulated and we departed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The house was there waiting for us. Inside its own time bubble. Life in the new Greece was odd. We wandered around the surrounding area. Athens was a village. Maybe it was forgotten by everyone. It was a sign that things had not turned out as they were supposed to… it was the Acropolis! Only ruins were around. No churches, not even temples. But what had happened? All three of us were devastated. We found a local who spoke broken Greek.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Fellow man, what happened here? Where are all the Greeks?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘The Greeks?’ he began laughing out loud! ‘Why are you laughing?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The Greeks are like nomads now. They have no country. They don’t belong anywhere! Don’t take my word for it. The philosopher will know…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why do you call him that?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Let’s go and you’ll see. He lives further down in a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tent’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The situation was tragic! Humanity was sliding</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">towards monarchy. Some were shepherds while others were working as farmers. We had surely failed our purpose. We had to find out though what had happened. We arrived at the philosopher’s tent. He had a bushy beard.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Welcome, Argetes!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why did you call us that, philosopher?’ Asterios</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Don’t take offence, sometimes he talks nonsense.’ ‘We won’t take offence. We come from far away.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">From time to time, we’ve met many people, sometimes they’re strange, other times they’re more reserved. It’s fine…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Tell us elder, what happened during Alexandros’ time? How did Athens end up this way?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My children, you want me to go way back. I haven’t told this story for many years. Since you asked me, though, I will tell you.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Alexander had two sons. One was Phillip III and the other was Zeuxippus. The kingdom of Macedonia was split into two. The first son ruled the area up as far as India and the second central Greece and Egypt. The first years of the reign  everything  went  smoothly.  However,  Philip  was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">influenced by his grandmother Olympiada. Slowly he began to change his religious beliefs. He wanted to bring in Mithras’ principles. Foreign beliefs to Greece. Zeuxippus was patient and respected his brother’s beliefs, as he was the first born. But in the realm conflicts had began to arise. The situation got worse and in the end… war broke out. That resulted in the division of the kingdom. During his campaign, Phillip III, even tore down the Parthenon and every other temple that was in his way. Greece is only an idea now. We are only a few that remember our history. Others speak Scythian, others Roman. Those who speak our native language are even less. So only those who know can pass on the knowledge. They are not many left.<span class="p">’</span></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Thank you, philosopher, for your narration and don’t worry! There is still hope. Everything will be different once again!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><table border="0"

waiting for us. It was a beautiful morning in Persia. We had to go through the market. You could encounter all kinds of people from commoners to members of the royal court. All around you could hear people talking in Persian and Sanskrit. In Babylon the Macedonian guards were making their presence known. It was multicultural and it reminded us of our time. However, the situation was different. There wasn’t a central idea in the market. Everyone was following his own beliefs and maybe that was what we had to achieve together; to coexist under the same protective shield. That was the social situation in the Roman times as well and it was what led the empire to change course and as a result destroyed it. Something similar would happen with Alexander’s kingdom. History repeats itself. So whatever we did, there was always the chance that history could repeat itself whenever we tried to change its course. Could it be that we would never find the ideal situation for the nation? Those are some of the thoughts I had. I shared them with Asterios. He seemed to agree with what I was saying.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, everything you told me has substance. The only thing is that we have a mission and we have to see it through’.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: right;">‘I totally agree with you, Asterios, since we’ve</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">started it, we have to finish it. That’s certain. My question is;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">where does it end? What are the facts that will define were we should stop. In the end, which is the ideal Greece?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, the ideal Greece will be the one that when we see the situation in the 21<span class="s5">st</span> century it won’t be deteriorating! There should be consistence and harmony. The situation in our time is far from that. So we have to act accordingly’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, Asterios. The situation must take a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">different turn. We have to see our mission through’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We continued to wander around the market, some Macedonian guards approached us. They inspected us but they didn’t bother us. Suddenly…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My friends, Argetes, welcome to the centre of the East, where the traditions of Alexander’s kingdom meet’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Who could that be? It was Amersipos.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Fellows, come with me, I’m heading towards the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">court’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We said nothing and followed him. The guards</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">were his escort.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The King is always glad to help Greeks who are so far from their land. They are under his protection throughout the whole dominion’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 52pt;text-align: justify;">We arrived at the mansion that had been given to him by the King. He knew how to behave, as we arrived his servants greeted us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Amersipos, please tell them that there is no need for all this. We don’t want anyone to wait on us’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He told them to make themselves scarce.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘So, my dear wanderers, what brings you to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Babylon?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘We have to follow through a mission’. ‘What do you have to do?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Amersipos, we have to meet the King, we have to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">give him something’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I remember that the previous time our paths met you asked me for a favour then. I will help you again. From what I recall it was for Alexander’s own good. I know you are here to help him’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Thank  you  Amersipos  for  the  assistance’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Her  reaction  and  her  behavior  as  a  whole surprised me. I hadn’t seen her like this before. She bewitched Amersipos and impressed me.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Tonight some people from Ephesus’s library will come to visit him. If you want, I can take you with me. Now, I’ll rest because I haven’t slept all night. Go to the market to see if you want to buy anything. Come back later so we can dine and we’ll go to see the Macedonian later.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">And so we did.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The market sold everything from amber and spices to  pottery  from  Greater  Greece.  Incredible  objects, everything was worth looking at. Just after noon we returned to Amersipos’ mansion. A large meal had been prepared for all of us. They tried to impress us. Certainly, it was the best we had tasted for a long time.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Honestly, Amersipos, I don’t know where you have found all these recipes and foods that you are offering us. They are delicious’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, my fellow countryman, I would only serve the best to my own people’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Indeed, the whole experience was different, it was unprecedented. Dancers had arrived; they approached us and danced close to us. I don’t know, I felt a little awkward. I kept looking at Andromache. She didn’t mind. Whatever the case, we didn’t like the situation. I was never attracted to the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">eastern expressions of romanticism. It was something that corrupted the human existence. However, I was there and I had to do everything in my power not to insult our host because at the same time, the outcome of our mission was at stake. It could be that I was feeling dizzy from the wine and I wasn’t thinking clearly.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Amersipos told us that in a while we would depart to meet the King. We went to get ready. We changed our clothes and wore garments belonging to some Ephesians, who were also Amersipos’ visitors. We took horses to the royal apartments. Alexander was surrounded by both women and men. I thought it would be a lot worse. There weren’t indulging  in  any  inappropriate  activities,  there  were musicians with lutes and traditional Babylonian instruments which I didn’t recognize. I was obviously lost in the course of time. Amersipos announced us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hail King of the world!’ the Ephesian said first ‘We have come to seek you with the blessing of the Zeus of Ephesus!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Sit next to me, Greeks, my brothers!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Near the king there were only women. A few were wearing Macedonian clothing.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I couldn’t see Andromache anywhere close by. I didn’t know where she was. During our presence there, dancers kept appearing. They came near us and they were going from one man to another. Others were kissing us, while others  were  dancing  round  the  King.  One  of  them approached him, kissed him and offered him some wine. The representatives from Ephesus began pleading with the King in order to convince him to give them an amount so they could complete the temple of Apollo in front of the library. Alexander was listening to them but he began to feel unwell! Shortly, a physician was called to come to King Alexander’s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">room, where he was moved with the help of his guards. We were instructed to wait outside the room. Amersipos told us we should return to his mansion and that was what we did. As I walked out of the royal quarters, I saw Andromache. I wanted to ask her where she had been, but everything happened fast.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We arrived at the house! There was nervousness all around, about what was going to happen to the King. Everything was volatile. Asterios was constantly alert. I had a slight suspicion but I couldn’t decide what had happened. Asterios wanted to leave, to go back to find Amersipos. I asked him under what pretence would he go back to find him. He thought about what I’d said. He thought about it for quite a while. However, his thoughts and intensions came to an end. Our host was back. He had his head bowed…</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened to Alexander, Amersipos, is he</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">alright?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘None of the physicians managed to revive him! He</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">has set sail for Hades now! He has gone to meet the rest of</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the great people of the nation’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What happened, Amersipos? What caused his</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">death?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘In one of the wine glasses someone smelled</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">scorpion poison. It was probably one of the dancers, but they can’t trace her. I want to rest for a while. I can’t bare this weight. I’m going to my quarters’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Amersipos was obviously affected by the whole situation. In a weird way our mission was accomplished for now. I went in the room that had been given to us. Next to the bed I had my clothes. I got dressed. Next to my clothes there was a dancer’s outfit. When I went out of the room, I told Asterios that we had to leave straight away. Adromache looked at me. She realized that I had suspected something.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We got out of Amersipos’ mansion quickly. We took out the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">scroll and vanished. We had returned home.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What happened, Aristides, why did we leave in a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hurry?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Andromache was smiling.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Why are you laughing?’ Asterios asked her.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Tell him!’</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Tell him what? He should have realized!’ ‘Realize what? Tell me!’</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Listen, Asterios… Andromache was the dancer</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">who poisoned Alexander’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘But how? When? And how do you know?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘As I walked in our room I saw the dancer’s clothes and I realized that Andromache was missing all the time we were near the Macedonian. That was my impression. She disguised herself as a dancer and you can imagine the rest’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios began laughing…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Bravo!’ he said to Mache ‘You did well! Our mission has come to an end… women can be so cunning and devious!!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

prominent everywhere. Everything had carried on as we had left it. The thought that we traveled through time trying to change the outcome of space time and then returning back didn’t seem at all attractive to me. I feel now that after everything that had happened, I have no desire to stay in the present time. To return and remain in the time where I belong, we have to really find the ideal form so Greece can be as it should. Where it deserves to be. But what will that reality be? For what port should we set sail again?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Me and Asterios thought that we should visit the last descendent of the Ptolemaic dynasty. A definitely more favoured time for us Greeks. At the end of the Hellenistic period everyone spoke Greek and our position in the world helped us move freely. As representatives of the Oracle we needed a few days to organize our plan. Andromache had a different dynamic after everything that had happened in Babylon. She was very excited with the idea that we were going to visit Egypt again. It was indeed a time in history that would  remain  deeply  carved  in  our  memory.  The neighbouring people spoke of the queen of Egypt for centuries. We had to act very carefully because we were very lucky on our previous visit; but we wouldn’t always be. We should probably follow a different strategy this time.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios informed us that he had to go away for a few days. He had to, as he said, go on one of his trips as he felt the need to think. He obviously had a place where he</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">went to meditate. As always, his life was surrounded by mystery. So he began his journey for this unknown place.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Nightfall covered Attica’s sky. Andromache lay next to me. I couldn’t sleep. I felt the need to see what was on the scroll that the old man from Thebes’ market had given me. I unrolled the scroll. I couldn’t believe what I saw. It was the same as the one we had found in the archaeological excavation. It was unbelievable. How could that be? Who could have written this scroll? It was unthinkable. How could there be so many questions with no answers? Could there be more scrolls? Where did they come from? Who was the elderly merchant that gave it to me and why? Obviously he knew who I was and the purpose of my visit to Thebes. The main question remained, why would he give the scroll to me? It was worth thinking about. Besides, who was it that kept helping me? Who could predict our movements? I was really confused. I didn’t know how to react or what I should do. I always followed my instinct.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So I went out the house to see the starry sky of Attica. Whatever the case I had to act very carefully. After a while Andromache sat next to me. She asked me why I was so quiet.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Sometimes we should think more and talk less. Let those around us express their opinion or better still let the events speak for us. We don’t need to say too much.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You might be right, Ares, but it was your impulse that taught me during the turmoil at the archaeological school, it was you who made a difference. You approached the facts from a different angle. That, as well as other virtues, was what I found attractive about you.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry, Mache, I haven’t changed nor do I see things differently. My soul remains the same. I was just</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">enjoying the stars. I did exactly the same thing with Sofroniskos outside Laceses’ house. Meditation under the starlight, maybe that is what has changed inside me. Only that. Go and lie down, my dear. I’ll come in a while.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">She kissed me softly and went back to bed. I, however, had set sail for elsewhere. I held my scroll in my hands. I let my imagination lead me where it wanted. I ended up near Tithorea. The scenery was significantly different compared to my time. A lot of things made the situation different. I didn’t know what I had to do. It was definitely a good chance to explore the area, so let my feelings lead the way. I had no clue about what I should do and where I had to go. Nothing surfaces without a purpose. Everything was part of a plan. However, as I mentioned before, I hadn’t any particular purpose at that moment. So, I would continue based on how I felt. I headed towards Delphi. One place that remained alive for over a millennium, like the birthplace of Hellenism. The core of the culture. While thinking of all that, I observed the scenery. It was here where the ancients built the house of Phoebus, it was protected by the landscape. The surrounding area, the nature, everything was harmonised with Delphi.  The temple of Apollo appeared from a great distance. I had to find an appropriate outfit. It was spring so I needed something light. I wore the clothes I had from Egypt. I enjoyed collecting the clothes from the trips and visits. Something that didn’t leave a clue back in my time. Just a reminder from our experiences. Something I could have with me forever.  Something that  would  show me that  what Andromache, Asterios and I were experiencing, was not a dream. It would be nice if I could share with the rest, especially Andromache, everything that was going on now. I really wanted to share with her a visit to a different place. In an era that we could go without being able to affect our</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">future. I hoped that we could fulfill at some point this wish I had. I reached a place where a stream was flowing. The water was cool and refreshing, really good! I rested for a while  as  I  had been walking for  quite  some time.  A bearded man riding a donkey approached me. I asked him a question.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I would like to ask you, is it a good time now to visit the Oracle’s temple?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course, young man! After the Athenian General left, the everyday routine has returned to normal. Whenever someone from the city of Glaukomata comes, we are ready because they are one of the main funders of the temple.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How do you know so many things about what’s happening inside the temple? I believe that this information shouldn’t be made known to everyone!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry, young man! Here the citizens of Fokida trust one another and you being here and talking to me means that you are not a barbarian! You must be a descendent of Deucalion! What’s your name, young man?</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, and yours?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m Anelphipos. What are you seeking from the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oracle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I want a prediction about what I’m supposed to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">do. It’s something I need because my local community needs an answer immediately’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where do you come from, Aristides?’ ‘From Methoni’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Ahh… it’s beautiful, so I’ve heard, but I’ve never been  there.  I  always  sit  and  listen  to  the  travelers’ conversations. They’ve always got something remarkable to offer.  Some  information.  Each  visitor  has  his  own experiences; he has built his own reality. You can find out what’s going on in the greater area where the Greek cities</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are found’. The animal drank some water. ‘If you want we can go together to the Oracle, Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Let’s go, Anelphipos’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So we headed there without speaking. Time went by with only the sound of silence. Arriving at the gate, guards were there. No one who hadn’t previously notified his arrival at the Oracle’s temple could enter. You had to announce and inform well in advance the reason why you wanted to visit and the prophecy you sought. It was like they had already told you what you wanted to hear. Or was it karma? Could it be the Fates that lead you to this place? Nobody knows. From time to time, different representatives of Greek cities were present in the area.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The Athenian treasure was there, it was really different and for a long time it was the most impressive building after the temple of Phoebus. It was an outdoor museum with works of art all around. It was almost incomprehensible the way the place was designed. Statues everywhere. It was a workplace. The impressive thing was that everyone was walking around freely. Men and women. Everybody was talking, attending to something or was creating a work of art. The famous equality between people was present even though we archaeologists think that only in the 20<span class="s5">th</span> century we have achieved this. We were definitely wrong. Here at Delphos there was absolute social harmony.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I asked Anelphipos to allow me to wander around the premises alone for a while. I walked behind the temple where there was an olive tree. A woman was sitting there knitting, carefree.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good morning, young man’. ‘Good morning, miss!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">She smiled at me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apollo?’</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What are you seeking here at the temple of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I am here to learn. My land is threatened by the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">barbarians and I have to find a way to protect it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I can see that your intensions are sincere and full of passion for your land. That is very good! You could have turned your back on it! The Laconians frequently become victims of wealth, they are bribed easily. One fine example is the battle at Thermopiles. A Laconian betrayed Leonidas’ soldiers.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Miss, how do you know so many things about the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">battles and the history of Atreus’ descendants?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My child, people come here from all over the world. They help us and tell us all about their land. The Oracle is informed about everything. In a strange way she knows more than what Apollo reveals to her. A continuous flow of facts.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Miss, is there a place where everything that</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happens to the people who come here gets recorded?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘There is a place where records are kept but I don’t know of it. I have no access. It is forbidden for the people who do not belong to have contact with everything that happens in the inner sanctum of the temple. I’ve said too much. When do you want to see the Oracle? I can arrange it soon if you wish. But not today! Wander around the area, look around because not many people who come from so far have the chance to connect with the place.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Indeed, I walked around the area and my steps lead me to Anelphipos again. He had arranged for me to meet with the Oracle’s representative.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good  evening,  young  Aristides!  Anelphipos enlightened me that you would like to see the Oracle. Your word seems sincere, so tomorrow morning she will meet</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with you. Come alone, ask for Sofroniskos’ the representative</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Anelphipos and I walked towards the Temple’s exit. We were on our way out, when he ran into a familiar face and they began talking. I found a shrine covered in symbols that I had never seen before. I was examining it when a girl showed up.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why are you looking at the shrine with such curiosity? What’s so special about it?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I haven’t come across these symbols before! I was</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">curious and I wanted to examine them up close’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why did they catch your attention? Why are</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">those symbols so important to you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘That’s personal and I don’t feel like sharing it with you at this precise moment! Why are you so curious, miss?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t go out that often. When I am given the chance, I speak and I socialize with the wanderers in the area. I enjoy listening to new stories. The Oracle has instructed us to meet people so we won’t lose contact with the current events’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What’s your name?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Amphitriti, I am a follower of the temple’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anelphipos came so I had to leave.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Nice to meet you, Amphitriti!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I hope we’ll meet again, Aristides’. ‘I hope so too! Enjoy your stroll!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Aristides, for your own good you’d better stay away from the girls of the temple!’ Anelphipos warned.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I hadn’t intended to approach her, so don’t</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">worry!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am worried about you, my friend, Aristides. From time to time, it is heard that they enchant young men and then they vanish’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t think it’s true, so don’t worry.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You never know, my dear friend! Let’s go now so we can eat, I’d prepared something before I left’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We walked to a settlement that was near the Temple. We went to his house. He was very polite, he offered food and shelter. His niece looked after him. She would inherit eventually. She attended to us. I then went to rest in a small corner of the house. It was quiet, I liked it there. Maybe it was good that I took a break from time travelling. It was tranquil and I was trying to find my own peace in this turbulent situation. I truly relaxed. There was the slight breeze that cooled Anelphipos’ house.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I wanted to see what the sun looked like behind the mountain. The sight was magnificent. The final sunrays timidly touched the strings of Phoebus’s harp. Whatever the Greeks built was exceptionally beautiful, as was the scenery, but the building surpassed it. Slowly the torches that lit the Temple of Apollo became visible. There were quite a lot of people wandering around. Their shadows seemed dark on the white Pendelis marble. I approached the Temple. At night, you feel like it is trying to seduce you. It’s like nightfall has the ability to make you forget everything you know. I wandered for a while and I found a spot where I could sit and enjoy the starry sky one more time like I did with Laceses at Thebes. I don’t know, I felt an inner awe. Inexplicable. But how could you explain everything that’s happened.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A sudden noise interrupted my thoughts… ‘Aristides…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Someone was calling me. Who could it be? They approached me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Come on, hurry, this way…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It was Amphitriti!</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you doing here all by yourself at this hour? Shouldn’t you be inside the Temple?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, I should, but I enjoy wandering. Maybe I was hoping to see you again!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What gave you the desire to come and see me?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know. There’s something different about you, even though I shouldn’t feel this way. We’re not allowed! No one from Methoni has ever come here before. There’s no mention of you in the records!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What records are you talking about, Amphitriti?’ ‘Only a record, nothing of note!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Amphitriti, I’ll tell you the truth. I need your help’ ‘What is it that you need?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘There is a prophecy about my land, that in time it will be destroyed and I don’t want to see that happen! I know that here in Delphos, when you confronted the Persians, someone from the temple took out the sacred weapons and destroyed the barbarian fleet before they had the chance to disembark.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How do you know all this? It’s something that isn’t known to everyone’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘It’s been written down somewhere! I can’t tell you but you have to trust me and I have to trust you!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, I trust you Aristides. Follow me…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know that there are some records, you can tell me the truth’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We went around the outside wall. At some point there was a crypt which we entered. The light from the torches added a mystery to the scenery. It was beautiful and fascinating. The energy that came out caused great awe to the visitor. I hadn’t felt such a mystical atmosphere at that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">level before. Amphitriti was holding my hand. I felt sure around her. I couldn’t explain it. I’d felt the same way with Andromache a while ago. Before our journey had begun. Mixed feelings. What I felt was powerful but in the meantime I had to follow the path of my plan. I shouldn’t let my feelings overcome me and that was particularly hard.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we were walking around the temple we reached a shrine.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Amphitriti, what are we doing here near the shrine? Besides the obscure symbols that are on it, I can’t understand why you brought me here’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">On the right of the shrine, she pushed down on the finger of a carved statue. Suddenly, the shrine moved from its position and in front of us underground stairs appeared. I didn’t know where these stairs led but I followed Amphitriti anyway. Sometimes the unknown scares me. She, however, was holding my hand tightly. It was a sign that I had to trust her. I should ask her many things. What’s the Oracle’s role in all of this? What could be the role of the priesthood?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We descended through a tunnel. After a few minutes of silence we walked into a large room. There were various kinds of scrolls and bookcases. There were numerous records stored in there. All the history of the world was here. There could even be some writings before the cataclysm. Everything that an archaeologist would be looking for was certainly here. Scientific research in all its glory. Around the bookcases there were various wooden tables.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Amphitriti, I would like to ask you why are there tables surrounding the area?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘From time to time, researches come and make copies of scrolls. In here there is all the knowledge of the world. Now and then people come from Brittany to Persia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They must be sent by their own Oracle. Knowledge is too precious and at the same time too dangerous to be given away freely. We must be very careful to whom we give it.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why do you trust me, Amphitriti?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know, I’ve never brought someone down</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">here before. Search for what you are looking for.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I have to find a way to protect the fleet of my</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">area’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I have something in mind, wait a minute. There is</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a scroll that mentions something that could be useful. Wait</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">here.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I sat and read one of the scrolls. It was the records of a sailor named Salamonda. Time passed and Amphitriti was nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">“<i>The sea was a dream and a nightmare for Salamonda. All his knowledge came from his travels. But he had lost everything on land that he owned. The life of a man can be so conflicting! The journey of life can offer you knowledge and unforgettable experiences. At the same time, everything you have left behind seems foreign”.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 50pt;text-align: justify;">Salamonda was right. After a journey like this, what could possibly seem familiar anymore? Maybe it could be the journey itself. Maybe you’ll be travelling forever.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Amphitriti returned…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I was worried you had forgotten me here. I feared that someone would find me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry Aristides, nobody comes here at this hour. Everyone from the Priesthood is at the temple. They are watching over the Oracle. I have two scrolls somewhere that could help you. For now I’ll give you one of them, which you have to return to me. In case it’s not helpful enough, you have to bring it back to me as soon as possible so I can give you the other one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why don’t you give me both, Amphitriti?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘If I give you both of them then you won’t return.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This way you have to come back’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course I’m going to come back since you kindly offer me you help. I don’t understand though; why is it necessary?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I want to see you again!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m honoured that you want to see me again!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Amphitriti had different intensions which she finally made clear. The contact I had with her was beyond anything I had experienced. It was like she had infiltrated my soul. Her spirit took over me for a while. I could not fully comprehend it. The magic of love. Later on we returned to the surface. I had to meet Pythia at noon. I don’t know if I was ready for that but I felt now that it was of secondary importance. Amphitriti had to prepare at the altar.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The sun had not risen yet. After these mixed feelings I had to pull myself together back on the path of logic. I returned to Anelphipos’ house. I lay down and curled up because I really needed to get some mental rest, but I didn’t relax enough. Although, when I got up in the morning I was full of energy. When I say morning, I mean just before noon. At that time my host came to wake me up.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Come on young Methonian, it’s time to meet the Oracle. You are very lucky you managed to get your prophecy so soon. You are favoured by the gods. You should feel lucky!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So we set off to the Oracle’s temple once more. He obviously hadn’t noticed my absence last night. I’d tried to be as discreet as possible. I had taken with me the scroll that Amphitriti had given me. I was hoping to see her again soon. She was one of a kind! The afternoon entry to the Temple was taking place with all the formalities. Things were very</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">different in comparison with last night. The procedures were strange.  A  strange  ceremony  took  place  that  wasn’t mentioned anywhere. Anelphipos left me in the hands of trusty Sofroniskos. Just before we entered the temple he poured water over my head, purified water from Castalia spring.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You can’t meet the Oracle unclean!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">He whispered some psalms. It didn’t last long but it was necessary. Only those who would meet her had to go through this procedure-ceremony. Finally, after waiting for a while, we entered the majestic temple of Phoebus. Together with Sofroniskos we were accompanied by the formal guards who always protected Pythia. In front of the altar stood the young women, who were members of the Priesthood. I tried to single out Amphitriti but I couldn’t see her anywhere, then the gates behind the large statue, depicting the god, opened. We kneeled bowing our heads. Pythia addressed me.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Methonian, you who love your land so much, listen… the solar reflectors are those that will protect your city’s fort.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Her face was covered with a light white veil. Only her eyes were distinguishable. These were the Oracle’s words and she left. They began to burn incents all around which represented the favour of the god, according to the myth.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Sofroniskos accompanied me outside.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen Methonian, if what the Oracle told you doesn’t satisfy you then come back again. These are her unofficial words. Farewell Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I thanked him and I went to find Anelphipos. He walked with me until I was out of the village.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Anelphipos, thank you for your help. Without you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I wouldn’t have managed to see my mission through’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I think you are exaggerating, my dear friend. You should know that you are always welcome in Apollo’s land.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">However, I had to go back to my land. I had a promise to keep.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I returned to the exact point where I had left. Something was troubling me. How would things turn out? At the moment there was no change. Andromache was lying where I’d left her. I gained as much as I lost. No one knows anything about this. It was something I shared with the locals of Delphi. I, as well, might have a new path to follow. With my thoughts and my recent memories I lay down next to Andromache.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Time passed, Asterios came back. He seemed to be more sure about the outcome of things.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We have to find a way to infiltrate Cleopatra’s fleet. It will be hard though, but I believe that we’ll reach our goal.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen, Asterios, I believe that we can find a way to see our mission through. We always find a way. Only by keeping contact with the people of the city we’ll be able to move freely and bring our mission to an end.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So our next journey began. We arrived at an area called Pantocratoras. The locals were restless as they waited for a battle to break out.  A battle that would define the development of the Roman Empire. To our good fortune the fleet of Cleopatra and Mark Antony had arrived earlier.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We might have the chance to board one of the boats. We had to move discreetly. We had to avoid attracting the attention of the locals, so we decided to stay away from the port on our first day. Asterios went to the port by himself to try and find a way to infiltrate the boat. It wouldn’t be easy though. We had to find a local who would be willing to take part. As a mercenary someone would agree. We would</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">certainly find a way like that. Near where we stood there was a beach and two ships. One of them seemed ideal for us to try and board. The area was full of citrus trees. We approached a community that was nearby. We found a barn we could use during our stay. Not many people were in the area.  They  were  probably  frightened  because  of  the upcoming battle.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Achaeans, what are you doing here far from your</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">country.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘We are trying to find who is responsible for hiring</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mercenaries.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘In the evening a Roman legionnaire will pass by to find people that want to be led to certain death.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Good, so we are waiting for one more Achaean</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -47pt;text-align: left;">who wants to sign up to be a great warrior.’ ‘Your name?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘My name is Solon, you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am Aristides and this is Andromache. Asterios, who is accompanying me, is about to return from the port.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘It is said that Cleopatra has also a woman on board as a representative of her palace. It is one of the things that have changed during her reign. Women are a vital part of the administration. In Rome, however, the Senate has not been affected by it. The Romans always follow what they see. They have never comprehended the real dimension of the Greek psyche. They even want to take them out of the priesthood. They believe that only men should be granted access in the altar. The equilibrium is lost. I don’t know where all this could lead.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Solon, you seem to know a lot about the administration and the geopolitics of your whole dominion.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Aristides, I am a local but many years ago my</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">family sent me to Athens to study in detail the teachings of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">our culture where important events take place. The ministry of Athens sent me to record the battle, how the events unfolded and of course the outcome of the whole situation.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We also move around, we are curious to see how things will progress. Andromache and I haven’t met before someone from the priesthood of Athens.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘In general, you should know that the priesthoods are in contact with each other. Sometimes one sends a representative, sometimes another. Usually we aren’t so open with the public. But you look like you’re travelers as well. Do you need my help?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, we would be grateful!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, maybe there is something I could do for</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">you. The legionnaire will listen to me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">When Asterios came back we informed him about the situation. He looked troubled. He told us that during his stay at the port he hadn’t managed to find a way to board one of the ships. The day passed with us worrying about how to board a ship. The Roman assessor arrived so he could look at our abilities and chose his mercenaries. But he didn’t assess us favourably. He rejected us. Eulomides tried to talk him out of it but without success. He said that we didn’t have one scar on our face from a battle. He didn’t want to send us to certain death. What he didn’t know was that battles are not won only by experienced soldiers, but by strategy as well. That is something that we know how to do now. We waited hopelessly to find a solution to our problem. Maybe we should postpone our intervention in history.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We headed towards the barn we had found earlier that day. Maybe the next morning we would find a way to board a ship. The night appeared to be a cold one, things wouldn’t always be easy. We don’t know anyone well here. But we’ll settle with what we’ve got. So we ended up in the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">barn and thankfully the weather was good. The night was not that cold after all. We found some old rags and placed them over the straw. Asterios slept straight away. He looked uneasy. I couldn’t figure out why this was happening. All of us were a bit nervous. But our companion talked in his sleep. He was certainly upset. He doesn’t open up easily. If he had something to tell us he would have done so. Something might have happened at the port that he wasn’t expecting. Andromache was next to me. She was a gorgeous creature. But down the road I don’t know, she didn’t express what she felt inside. She had become withdrawn. She might have lost herself in this situation. We’ve seen and felt many things. When we were in Egypt I was sure she wanted to stay there. Her passion for the land of the Pharaoh was great. In the era we are at the moment, their time has essentially ended. Cleopatra, a descendant of the Ptolemaic dynasty. I fell asleep with this thought.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The next morning, a sound was heard. Solon had come to find us.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Wake up quickly…’ he shouted at us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Octavius’ fleet is arriving in a few hours! He will take them by surprise. It is certain that they will lose the battle if they aren’t warned. I will go to tell the Roman legionnaire to prepare for battle. You, head to a small bay that is situated west from here. There you’ll find two ships, which I came from Athens on. We will sail as well so we can write about the battle. You’ll come with me since you want to be part of the battle. We’ll be safe. The Romans always respect the representative of the Oracle.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So with Solon’s encouragement we went to the bay. Asterios and Andromache were excited even though we wouldn’t take part in the battle. We would surely be witnesses to an extraordinary event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we arrived we found the Athenian followers preparing the two ships. Some of the soldiers were coming back with supplies they had gone to find. They had left their armor and I approached to take a look at their shields. They were in excellent condition from the inside. So what was written in the scroll Amphitriti had given me could be easily implemented. We helped them load the war supplies on the beautiful trireme. It was purely magnificent. I had never encountered such a well structured and majestic design before. Obviously triremes that represented an Oracle were designed and looked different. At the side of the mast were shields that depicted some gods while others bore the heads of heroes. When Solon returned I encouraged him to tell the soldiers to polish the inside of their shields with the pretence that they had to be in a perfect condition. So they polished all the shields from the inside as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Just before noon we dined on the ship. We were already in the Ambracian Gulf. We were quite a distance from the fleet. There was great nervousness. We had never been in a battle aboard a ship. I was hoping that we would be able to put our plan in action. Asterios was absorbed in observing the battle. Andromache was enjoying her lunch in the breeze that was blowing. We slowly approached the battle. Solon wanted to have a closer look of the events taking place. As we got closer however, we put in danger our entire mission. Maybe we were too close. You could smell in the air the scent of war. Octavius’ ships outnumbered them. Cleopatra  and  Mark  Antony  were  doomed  from  the beginning.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Suddenly,  a  ship  from  the  Roman’s  fleet approached us in a threatening way. They began shooting arrows at us. They chased us. It could be one of the Barbarians. It could be a mercenary captain, who didn’t know</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that the Oracle’s ship shouldn’t be threatened or attacked by either side. The arrows began striking the deck. One of them nearly pierced my shoulder. The situation was difficult.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Solon,  we  have  to  defend  ourselves</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">somehow!’Asterios yelled.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">No one knew how to react. Andromache was panicking and came closer to me. As she came nearer an arrow passed right above her head and pierced the heart of an Athenian soldier that was behind us and killed him instantly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">weapons!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Solon…’ I cried out ‘tell your men to pick up their</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘But if we provoke them, others will interfere in</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">the battle against us!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘The others will get involved whatever the case!</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We will fight so they won’t remember us as martyrs!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Tell your soldiers to turn their shields round the other way, from the inside, the sunrays will do the rest don’t you worry! This is one way we can defend ourselves. It has to be done now before you lose any more men and then we’ll be doomed!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Solon gave the order. His soldiers picked up their shields and so did we. The ship turned its stern round facing the sun. The shields acted as reflectors and they either blinded the Roman soldiers or they set fires on their ships. The first ship burnt down. The scroll’s technique seemed to be effective. Solon however, was overtaken by the heat of the moment and wanted to sail towards the battle as well. He ordered to set sail against Octavius’ ships. He thought it was a great offence the fact that they had attacked us. Octavius’ second ship was destroyed. Cleopatra’s and Mark Antony’s ships began mimicking our technique. They began to move forward. The course of the battle was changing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I left the deck and went down into the hold of the trireme. I took out my scroll and returned to the Athens of my time. At the house I began worrying about what I would encounter if Andromache and Asterios found out about my absence.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As  I  went  out  the  house,  I  encountered  a developed civilization. More developed than ours. I met people, who although the language they were speaking was Greek, it had Latin elements incorporated. Things had probably taken a different turn. I noticed that everywhere around me there were temples dedicated to Osiris and the symbol of the snake. As I was walking I found something that resembled a touch screen. I had never found a technological advancement of this era before. There was a narration from a hologram. It explained the Cleopatra’s reign of Athens, which protected the city from its enemies. She was also worshiped as a goddess by the city. My return to Delphi was hastened. This attempt had also failed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I had to find Amphitriti. Sofroniskos might know where she was. I went again to the Oracle. My visit there had to be short. Anelphipos was near the temple.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Welcome, Methonian…’ he embraced me. ‘We meet again’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What brings you here, Aristides?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I need the help of the priesthood again. They encouraged me to seek their help again if I needed it.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Things turn out as expected I presume.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, my dear friend, that’s why I have to go and find Sofroniskos. What brings you here at the Oracle’s temple, Anelphipos?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I brought some herbs for the Oracle. I search for medicinal herbs in the valley. I don’t know what exactly they heal but I do what I’m asked to do. I know that with some of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the roots and bulbs they come closer to God. So what I do is necessary. Let’s go together, I’m taking them to Sofroniskos to check if that is what the Oracle needs.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">As we passed the shrine we saw Sofroniskos.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I met you together and now I see you again together! What brings you here again?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I bring you your herbs, priest.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And you, Methonian, have you come here to pray</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">or are you here to seek our help again?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I need the Oracle’s advice again. I have to meet with the Oracle in person.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Tonight, if she’s available because these last few days after the Panathinaia she feels tired. Her mood is somewhat strange’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We went to the priesthood to drop off the herbs. I helped Anelphipos. As we entered, I ran into Amphitriti. She didn’t look surprised to see me. She came close to me. She helped me put the herbs in a small storage room that was near. She led me there…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I knew I was going to see you again…’ she kissed me passionately and I responded! It was something that I wanted to happen as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen, Aristides, when the sun sets come to the same place outside the wall so you can give me the scroll back and I’ll give you the other one…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I agreed. It was like she knew what I wanted. When I saw her again I felt I strange attraction. It was like deep down I wanted to see her again.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I left the temple with Anelphipos. His niece was surprised. She didn’t expect to see me again. She prepared a meal for us. Dusk soon came. I had to move carefully. I went to the Oracle again that night. Like the first night I was there, I had the feeling that the environment around was alive, it</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">was like it was participating in the rituals of the moon. At night the moon gave the orders.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Amphitriti was on time at our meeting place. We went together towards Apollo’s shrine where it all started. Another chapter in my life.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Representatives of the Oracle of Babylon will arrive sometime soon so we can record facts that should be in our library.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I want at some point to sit and read some of the scrolls. I have a thirst for knowledge, Amphitriti.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, the more often you come here, the more knowledge you will gain.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you want in return?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You should know that the price is of a different nature but I know that you haven’t been honest with me!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you mean I wasn’t honest with you?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why are you saying that?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know that you are not from Methoni and that</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Athens is the city you come from’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re right. But how do you know this? No one</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">knows who I am. How could you possibly know this?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I pleaded the Oracle to confide in me the secrets you’re hiding. Many of which have come true. Now the only thing that is left for us to see, is if what she’s told me about the future will happen.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are confusing me! What has she told you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I can’t share it with you. It is forbidden by the priesthood to talk about it. Only the Oracle herself can give you your prophecy. But she will tell you slowly, she won’t reveal everything at once! And you can’t continuously keep meeting with her. You can’t because of your situation.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You should know I don’t have selfish reasons,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amphitriti! My real cause has to do with the good of Greece.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, I know the reason you came here. I have a map to give to you that has marks where the river of Hades springs out from the ground. I’m giving it to you so you can find your solution…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: right;">I gave her back the first scroll she had given me. Before I left again I had to give her what she asked in return for it. Another night of passion with her. No one knew how many more there would be. What struck me was the fact that she knew so much. I felt like I was at a disadvantaged. I didn’t know what was going on inside the priesthood. I had to convince Amphitriti to share with me everything she knew. I returned again to the Ambracian shore where</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Octavius would lead his fleet. I had to find one of his legionnaires.  Indeed,  the  roman  legionnaires  had disembarked earlier than we thought. Maybe that’s why Asterios was grouchy, he had realized that Augustus’ fleet had arrived earlier but he didn’t tell us. I was guessing, it could in fact not be true.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">One of the locals, who had given us some information, also had great influence on the people of the area. He promised that in case of victory the roman commander would build a magnificent city to honour the participants and that’s what happened. Nicomachus was his name. I looked for him. I headed to the edge of Actio. I searched for several hours. Finally I ended up in a bay. There was a small boat. Someone with a beard was near the shore.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Nicomachus?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Yes, who’s asking?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘My name is Asterios’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘And what is the reason you are looking for me,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Achaean?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I have a proposition for you. I have come from the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">land of Pheobus to plead with you to hear me out.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am obliged to hear you, even though I don’t have much respect for the gods this period. I’m listening though what are you suggesting?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We’ll go together to the river of Hades. There is something there that is going to assure us victory.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry about winning Asterios, Augustus’ legionnaire has guaranteed that we will succeed. We don’t need your help.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘There is something you don’t know, legionnaire. The Oracle of Orpheus in Egypt has given them a secret weapon that will allow them to defeat us.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘So let’s presume you’re right. What are you going to gain from our victory?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Nicomachus, I carry out the orders of the Oracle. If you want your land to prosper then you’ll take my advice.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, let’s say that I agree. What do we have to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">do?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Take some of the ships that are available. We’ll go</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to the river of Hades and bring some of the water here. We want plenty of men with us. Tomorrow’s the battle so it’ll be wise to set off immediately. You should know we’ll need many buckets. It might take all night but in the end we will succeed!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So after the sunset we went where the map showed that we would find the river of the underworld. So we continued all night as planned, at the source where the black blood of the earth, as the locals called it, sprung. The Abracian Gulf had changed colour. Amphitriti’s advice was effective. It was tiring but when dawn came we were all ready for battle.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The legionnaire had come to find us. He gave orders to prepare for battle. Octavius’ fleet had arrived. So we also prepared to play our part. Some of the ships of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">fleet had a different role. They were ordered to attack when a trireme was separated from its position in the formation. And so the war began.  After Solon’s trireme had burned some ships, the rest of Cleopatra’s fleet followed and went into battle.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">There  were  many  casualties  from  the  very beginning. But soon Octavius’ ships stopped sailing. Our opponents sailed towards us in a line. Solon’s trireme had changed its course. Everyone hoped that they would be safe on the ship. One of Octavius’ archers shot a flaming arrow in the sea. All of Egypt’s ships burned! I jumped in the sea and swam to the shore. I saw from there through the smoke the trireme with my fellow companions on it. I cried for help. They recognised me quickly and came to rescue me. Andromache looked terrified.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘During the battle I lost my balance and fell in the sea. In the heat of the battle anything could happen. I don’t know what happened I might have lost my courage or I might have got dizzy and fell in. It’s all a bit blurry.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What’s important is that you’re alright, Aristides’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Things could have turned out differently. What if an arrow had struck you or if the ship had sunk and something worse happened to everyone? We can’t change some things’ Asterios pointed out.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, anything can change! That’s why we’re here to see if we can find a solution to our problem. I think that we should continue our conversation somewhere else. It’s not the right time’ Aristides said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My  friends  Achaeans,  we  have  to  anchor somewhere so we can repair the damage and we can set sail for Athens once again. Unfortunately, we lost many of our fellow soldiers from the other trireme! It was something</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">unpredictable. The way they were defeated in battle had surely a divine intervention. Octavius must have had contact with an Oracle, there is no other explanation for winning the battle so easily. Maybe he offered a large amount to a representative of an Oracle.  There are many who love money around us even though they have taken an oath of silence so they wouldn’t tell anyone what they’ve seen and learnt. They are dangerous and dark! You should watch out on your travels as well, wherever it is you go. Like the mercenaries you should also be careful were you offer your services’ Solon warned us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We embraced each other and left the memory of the battle behind us. It was time to return to our era. We are now walking on dangerous paths. Darker times. When we changed and became Romans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><table border="0" cellspacing="0"

meeting of Nicaea</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 34pt;text-align: left;">‘I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: justify;">am really surprised how things have turned out. Everything has happened so fast. How can</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">events take such a turn from one minute to the next? On the one hand, we used the shields as reflectors and on the other hand, I feel like they had set a trap for us. How could they know about our plan since it wasn’t obvious how we would act?’ Asterios asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘They attacked us first, Asterios, with no obvious reason and we had to fight back. We would have been killed. It was necessary, my friend’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are absolutely right. As Solon mentioned before they shouldn’t have attacked because they knew that the ship had been sent by the Oracle’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The main thing is that we are safe and sound! We should thank God for that. We should have thought it through more, so on our next trip we have to prepare ourselves better. We have to decide where we should go’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You look worried, Andromache, you shouldn’t be’. ‘How am I supposed to feel? I was nearly struck by</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">an arrow and could be lying dead on the deck of the ship and we wouldn’t be speaking right now, plus Aristides fell in the water during the battle. We could both be dead and you’re telling me that I shouldn’t worry? Of course I should because one of us must bring us down to earth. Maybe we shouldn’t play with time’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We have been through this before. We have been through a lot to back down now. We have to pull ourselves</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">together and move forward. We have to find the Romans and see how we can convince them about what should be done. It will be hard to go against the Romans. Constantine the Great is a difficult and controversial personality’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I had my reservations as well to go to that era. Many things had changed since the Hellenistic period. With the spread of Christianity the battles in the Roman Empire had reached their peak. Human life wasn’t worth anything. The decline of the spirit and mind had come. The progression of humanity throughout history had nothing to do with the value of the spirit. Even in the most civilized, supposedly, societies of my time, people envy each other and their morals have vanished. When a human reaches the sacred road of Virtue and Philosophy then he is given the chance to make great steps of spiritual progress. That’s the ideal. That is what we have to achieve so we can dispose of prejudice and we can distance ourselves from materialism.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Nicaea was beautiful those days. It was the centre of  cultural  and  spiritual  gathering.  Representatives  of Christianity had arrived from all over the world. With the famous phase “<i>In hoc signo vinces” </i>“<i>In this, conquer</i>” the regrouping of Christianity here in Nicaea lay the foundations for the forthcoming course of the religious consciousness of the western world. We had to find a way in.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">There were Arians, who were Copts of the Arabic peninsular, from Rome. In the Hellenic area some Greeks had already began to embrace Christianity while other remained true to the philosophy and the progression of the mind. It was always there, a bright force. Even in the darkest times. Always there to remind and guide people to the virtue of the spirit. Maybe we should give the light to Christianity, to give the true nature to the freedom of the spirit. Maybe the secret gospel of Paul the Apostle should be written by us. The</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">secret Church of the Apostle, which had the purpose of establishing the son of God as he should be.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We had many things to prepare so we had to move  carefully.  Our  task  wasn’t  easy.  The  emperor’s counselors were the ones that influenced his decisions. It was an era where everything could take an unpredictable turn. No one knew what would have happened if he hadn’t set the foundations of secularism. My curiosity was growing. I wanted to see the capital up close but it wasn’t possible right now. Our desires take over us sometimes and control our being. They might rule our whole life.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we arrived at the place where we would take part in the meeting we had to find somewhere to spend our night. In the meantime we had to find somewhere where we could write our own gospels. Our stay there would be basic again. We walked to a poor settlement we found there. Near the stables was a small house. It probably belonged to one of the stable workers. No one had spent the night there for quite a while. It was only a temporary shelter for us. Our journey had tired us out.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I went outside the small house to find some wood because it looked like it would be cold at night. There was a grove nearby and several dry logs. It was hard to carry them on my own. When I returned with my first log I found Asterios and Andromache together writing the scrolls of Paul the Apostle. They were deeply focused on their work. It was certain that they would see it through. I had never dealt with wood before nor did I have any inclination towards nature. However, from all the travels and the different scenery we have encountered, I believe that humans should harmonize with the environment. We all come from mother earth.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">The sunset unfolded. I hadn’t found many logs. I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">hoped though that we could make it through the night. It was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">bitter cold that night. Andromache had curled up next to me. She wanted as my partner to express her affection. I was concerned because Asterios was staying in the room next to ours.  We  had  to  be  discreet.  It’s  hard  under  these circumstances. The experience was different but I didn’t know why. Andromache though expressed some primitive feelings.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">At some point before dawn I had a sudden desire to exit the room. Asterios was absent. He was absent again; but where could he have gone? We didn’t know anyone here. I was curious to find out where he had gone but I put my curiosity aside and went back in the room. Andromache was sleeping silently and peacefully. She looked calm in comparison with before. It was like something had taken over her. Maybe with all the alternations she had lost herself and how could she not get lost in the path of time? I am also lost but at a personal level, in the path of the moment, in the various images and somewhere in the arms of Amphitriti.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Travel, joy, friends. All the social encounters were now subjected to the needs of the nation. It is impossible to find a new port, so we’ll relax for a while. Our everyday life sails in unknown waters and it is filled with alternating scenes and people that even the bravest sailor wouldn’t believe he could encounter. Even Odysseus, the greater mariner, knew that he would win back his crown, beside him were always Penelope and Telemachus.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">In which port am I going to anchor? I might not make it to my port. I might get lost on the way, I might lose one of my fellow travelers. And then what? Who will decide whether or not I should save Andromache or even Asterios the resourceful, the mysterious, and what if something happens to me? Who is going to save me?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I must ask someone for advice. Who could guide me at this hour? Only one person could give me the answers that I seek so desperately… the one that brought logic to mankind. I sweetly kissed Andromache on the cheek and I looked for my scroll.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">It was a misty morning. On the one side was Hymettus and on the other there was Pan, the god of nature of mountain wilds, hiding with his deer. Attica’s rich land. I claimed to be from Acharnea, follower of the famous Asterios the Archaean, who gave that incredible speech a few days ago. Those were my words when I met the Teacher because I knew he didn’t meet foreigners easily. But I wasn’t a stranger to him. We had met before in the theatre of Dyonisus.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">It was still early. He usually arrived at the agora around noon. But everyone in the city was up and alert. In a few days the trireme would be sailing for Syracuses. Everyone was practicing from very early so they could learn the new defense and offence techniques. Alcibiades’s voice was echoing throughout the buildings of the agora. However the politicians, the speakers and the philosophers weren’t participating. The supposed aristocrats of the nation never took part in the campaigns or the battles that took place, with the pretence that there must be someone left to carry out the responsibilities of governing.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As I walked towards the agora I found the Teacher sitting on a rock gazing straight ahead. It was strange. He always had someone next to him trying to seize a small piece of his wisdom. As I approached him someone came up to me and told me that he didn’t want to speak to anyone today. Socrates said:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Philimona, let young Aristides come near me.’ ‘You remember me Teacher!?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course, we only met each other a few days ago. Clotho must be bringing you back to me again! Let’s go together to walk round the beautiful, sacred rock. We have a lot to talk about.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Teacher, I won’t ask you how it is that you know everything that I want to tell you.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, someone doesn’t have to know your everyday life so he can understand you. You are obviously troubled in order to come and see me again. So tell me what is it that Phoebus sent you to seek me about.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Teacher,  my  companions  and  I  have  been traveling for quite a while now. We go from one city to the next and from one Oracle to another. We collect knowledge and we try to influence the local leaders so they can create the ideal society. The society that we believe as ideal and not as the local leaders think it is.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What is the ideal that you want to establish,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aristides?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘That’s what I’m wondering as well, Teacher. I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">think we are continuing our journey aimlessly and we’ll never find what we so helplessly crave in order to establish it at a place in our country. I honestly don’t know which direction we should take. Maybe our purpose is meaningless.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Young man, nothing will be in vain, everything is part of the journey! Your life and your desires are the ones that will lead you to the point you want.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, Teacher, but by trying to find the ideal, people’s lives are in danger.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry about that, in the course of history many people are lost and are found lost. Nothing is fruitless since everything and everyone serve a higher purpose that can’t be seen by most citizens. The ideal that you are looking so hard to find will come at the right moment. The journey</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you have chosen to make will definitely lead you somewhere</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">more favourably than where you are now.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Teacher, I hope you are right about what you’re</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">saying.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘The fates are those who will weave the thread of</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">your life so the only thing you can do is the best for you and for the people that are close to you. The gods reward those who seek virtue in their lives.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Your words give me strength.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I leave you surer and psychologically stronger about what you should do’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I thank you, Teacher Socrates.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I hope I can be useful to you again on our next encounter’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I was thinking that the Teacher’s words were wise and full of virtue. I was puzzled about his confidence that we would meet again. I really wanted to stay but I had to return to the house in Nicaea.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">When I arrived Asterios wasn’t there. The strange thing was that Andromache was missing as well. But where could they be? My question was; why didn’t she return the moment I was leaving? Whatever happened to Andromache should have found us together. Never before had the time space continuous changed. What was it that had affected it? More unanswered questions and no one to answer them. The  sun  was  starting  to  fade  away  slowly.  Someone approached the house. I found a piece of wood that I could use to protect myself from anyone that came too close. Whoever it was, was holding a torch so my worries were alleviated. When the door swung open, I saw Asterios.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My friend, we have a problem! Andromache has vanished! I stepped out of the stable for a while and when I came back she was gone!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘We have to find out what happened’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We both remained quiet, thinking, as the sun covered everything with its rays. There was dead silence.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Since our journey first began it was the first time I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">didn’t know what to do.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The  Teacher  should  have  been  near  me throughout the travels. Only he could guide us. But my thoughts led nowhere. The galloping of horses was heard. Someone was coming towards us. I grabbed the log I was holding a minute ago to protect myself. Asterios put out the torch he had brought with him. We didn’t speak. The sound of the horses stopped. I was petrified. The pieces of wood we had wouldn’t be able to protect me or my fellow companion, Asterios.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Strangers, whoever you are, you should know that you are trespassing on the house of the Chaldean the Nicaean.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -47pt;text-align: justify;">Come out and surrender. We won’t kill you!’ And that’s what we did…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We went out and kneeled. It was obvious who the Chaldean was! He was wearing Greek attire and he was clearly ruling the area since the emblem of an eagle was on the front of his clothes.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where do you come from and what do you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">want?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘We are followers of the secret brotherhood of</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paul the Apostle from Athens’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘And what are you looking for here in Nicaea?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘We have come to represent our Lord’s true will.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -47pt;text-align: left;">We had a woman with us who is now missing!’ ‘Is she called Andromache?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Yes! Do you know where she is?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, I know. Marquise, the commander of the legion and supporter of the bishop of Nicomedia, has taken her with him. I believe that he wants to offer her to Constantine as a means to impose his own beliefs. This however, shouldn’t affect Flavius’s judgment and decision.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We have to stop the Marquise. He has dangerous ideas and if he gets persuaded he might tear apart the foundations of the Roman dominion. It is the time of great changes. We have to get ahead of the events’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’ll come with me to see what message the brotherhood of Paul the Apostle wants to send. Get on the horses. You’re with me now. With me as your ally you’ll be able to save your fellow companion’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m curious what the Marquise was doing here’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Let’s  get  going  because  there  are  many unanswered questions. We have to find the key to the questions’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: right;">And so we did. We followed the Chaldean and we became part of the court that followed him. After a while we arrived at Nicaea’s palace. It was a beautiful building. Here still stood a temple, which clearly belonged to one of the gods of the old faith, but there wasn’t any statue that could identify who it belonged to. This was particularly bizarre. There weren’t any records of the meeting and Pausanias, the geographer, hadn’t mentioned anywhere the existence of a temple in this area. Maybe it was built in these last centuries.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I believe that we were going to be here for some days. I wouldn’t miss this chance and I would do my research. But the priority was to find Andromache. It must be done discreetly.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We were lucky that we had the Chaldean on our side. It would be an opportunity to see if Asterios would leave again and because of the situation I have the feeling</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that he won’t. We have to be able to carry out the mission together. We went into the bedrooms. Asterios and I would share the same room.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We left our things and we went to bed. I lay down and tried to think about everything that had happened. There must be a way to make sure Andromache was alright. I talked to Asterios about it…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I want to find her as much as you do but we are in deep waters and we are in an era where friends and family turn on each other and even kill one another, so we must act with caution.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Oh, Asterios, you are absolutely right but I feel like we can’t rely on anyone and we can’t trust anyone. Everyone surrounding us has something to hide and now I might not see again the woman I love!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry, you’ll see her again. When the sun</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hides we’ll go to look for her.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Our conversation was interrupted abruptly by the Chaldean’s stable worker…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We followed him and he led us outside the Chaldean’s room. Then we all followed him to the dining room. All the noblemen with their followers and their stablemen where there and they were dressed in the appropriate palace attire. It had been rumored that Flavius himself might attend. It would be interesting to meet him, he was one of the most remarkable personalities in history. The room was quite large. All the guests seemed to be present already but Andromache was not there. I hoped she was well. Without warning, the Chaldean stood up and left the table, he was talking to another attendee. They had already begun discussing the subject that was going to be addressed at the meeting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">She had been missing for quite a while. I had to find  a  solution.  I  really  worried  about  not  finding Andromache. After some time the Chaldean returned but for some reason he couldn’t locate the Marquise anywhere. This made me worry. He could be trying to force himself on her. This thought filled my mind. I couldn’t allow that. I would try to find her whatever the consequences, I couldn’t sit doing nothing.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Chaldean, I know that you have a lot on your mind and you have many responsibilities but something must be done to find Andromache. Her absence and not knowing whether she is well or not is something I can’t bare! I’ll go out to find her myself even though I don’t know the palace.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me, my friend Athenian. First we have to persuade the Emperor about the secret gospels of Paul the Apostle. The Empire’s salvation is above all of us. History won’t remember us. Our names won’t be recorded because we will have prevented the destruction, only the names of those who have betrayed the empire will remain deeply carved in the people’s mind. I won’t be one of them! As for your partner, don’t worry, they have her locked in a room with other girls of the Marquise. They are all meant to be given as gifts to Flavius. She is fine, don’t worry. Near the Marquise’s quarters is one of my stable workers. He might help us find her later. Be patient. We shouldn’t act quickly.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Thank you for looking into my case, Chaldean,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">even though I’m a stranger to you.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re not hostile towards me. I have met many people in my life. The passion for your partner is your motivation. Usually people that are under the spell of love exceed themselves so I have to ask you not to be impulsive.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The words of the Chaldean were wise but I didn’t</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">know if I could restrain my will to save my loved one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After our lunch we headed to our rooms.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, you shouldn’t be worried! As the Chaldean said we’ll find a solution.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I also believe he has the best of intentions, Asterios, but I don’t know if he’ll manage to act in time. Anything could happen at any time, she could be physically in danger. At sundown I will try to find her. I know that I’m jeopardizing the mission, the words of the Chaldean are right, the nation is above everything, but I can’t see it like that right now. What counts is that nothing happens to her. I know that I’m looking at things differently’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, you are seeing things from a different angle but Aristides we are a team! We have to save Andromache at any cost from the evil that awaits her. Be patient the Fates are always on our side, help will come from somewhere.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I hope you are right, Asterios. Let’s rest now</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">we’ve had an exhausting day.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I was exhausted by the sudden tiredness that overwhelmed me, so we each lay down on our own bed. The time passed with only one thought running through my head; Andromache’s rescue. Sundown was the best time for me to save her. Asterios was not very active the last days, he was the one usually taking all the initiatives. He was the leader. Later on I would give the necessary attention to his matter.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Darkness fell. My thoughts became more intense. My friend was lying down. Maybe he was troubled by his thoughts, which he rarely made known to anyone. I went to the left wing of the palace according to the description of the Chaldean. I walked with caution. I didn’t want to make a sound as a guard could ask me why I was going to the other side of the chambers. There was suspicion amongst all the members of the meeting. In every wing the guards changed. I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">became impulsive and headed forward without thinking that my life could be in danger. I could hear voices at a distance coming towards me. It was a group of guards since I could hear the shields clanking against the swords. I headed back towards our room but it was already too late. One of the soldiers approached me with hostility. I dropped my sword, I turned pale. I felt my life being threatened.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Princess, what shall I do with him?’ ‘Let him tell us who he is’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Show mercy, Empress. I am a follower of the Chaldean from Nicaea. You can ask him. If he denies it I will accept the consequences’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry, your fate will soon be decided. Bring the Chaldean before me immediately so I can decide whether or not you will hang’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">If the princess’s words were real my fate was already sealed! The few seconds that passed until the Chaldean came were endless! At that moment my life was being determined.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Fellow companion, Aristides, stand up!’ the voice</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the Chaldean brightened my soul again.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I had never been so scared in my life…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 50pt;text-align: justify;">‘Stand up, my friend, we were coming to find you. I explained your problem to the princess, she will deal with it personally and free Andromache. Where is your friend Asterios? Let’s go and fetch him as well so we can go to the Marquise’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we approached our room Asterios realized that something was going on and came out to see what was happening, he followed us without hesitating. Having as an ally the Emperor’s sister we had an advantage against the Marquise. However, I shouldn’t be arrogant, it wouldn’t be easy to take her back. The Marquise kept her as a trophy. We</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">quickly walked the corridors and reached his wing. His guards approached us immediately. The princess’s follower ordered him to come out of his room, and so he did.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Your majesty, how can I offer you my service?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The only thing I want from you, commander of Nicomedia, is to set free one of my priestesses with the name Andromache.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I would really want to grant the majesty’s wish but the girl of whom you speak of is going to be offered to Flavius as a courtesan.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Marquise, are you refusing to follow my order?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘My dear lady, I told you that she is a gift to your</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">brother!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Men, go and bring her to me!’</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The Marquise’s guards attacked us. I should have</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">brought a shield with me. One by one the men of the kidnapper fell but he kept on encouraging them that they shouldn’t surrender and that they should follow his orders. I grabbed a shield from one of the guards who was lying on the floor and I went in the room that was filled with young women. A guard tried to strike me but I managed to block him. I couldn’t spot Andromache anywhere. The sword of the guard nearly pierced my shoulder. The guard fell on the ground. Andromache broke a vase on his head and she ran into my arms. Princess Constantia’s guards arrested the Marquise. He would remain restrained and the personal guard of Flavius’s sister would be responsible for guarding him. I approached the Chaldean and I thanked him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You don’t have to worry about anything Aristides, I told you that what I do, I do for the good of the Empire and you are an important part of it. Everything is for our own good. Now we have to prepare for tomorrow. Go to your rooms. In a few hours I’ll send someone so you can come and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">present your writings. We must have ready your arguments</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so we can succeed.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We returned to our rooms. Andromache was</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">quiet…</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘I can’t believe that I found you again! I thought I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was going to stay there forever! How did you manage to find</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">me?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My dear, it’s a long story. If it wasn’t for the Emperor’s sister we might never have had the chance to save you. We owe this to the Chaldean. The house where we were staying belonged to one of his stable workers. He explained to her that we came from Athens from the brotherhood of Paul the Apostle whose main purpose was to bridge both sides of Hellenism. That’s how we convinced her and she told Constantine of our intentions. She has embraced the creative power of the Sun. Apollo’s power hasn’t died out yet.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How did it all happen without us having planned</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">anything?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘It could have been the Fates or it could have been</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a series of coincidences.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, you should know by now that nothing is a matter of coincidence!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You may be right, Asterios, but it’s not the right time to talk about it. Andromache must calm down and rest. We’ll have the time to analyze it later.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, you are right Asterios, I’m still very upset. I have to rest for a few hours, we were fortunate that no one attempted to violate our bodies. The Marquise wanted the women that were under his protection unharmed, but a few of them came close but managed to escape his guards some of which had violent intensions. None of us knew if we were going to escape them. Thank goodness we did!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">She lay next to me and I held her.

knows what could have happened to her during the days she was missing. I’m sure that all this will eventually surface even though Andromache is a strong character. She didn’t like to worry others with her problems. She had her own way of dealing with things. You might feel like she was distancing herself but it wasn’t always the case because she always kept you close to her in a way. Those who knew her well could tell that it was her way of protecting herself. I felt it sometimes. She was pushing me away, as many people do, each with their own personality and experiences. I had to be there for her whatever the case. It was a test for all of us. Asterios was more reluctant in the way he acted and spoke to us. Everything could have happened in order to make us stronger. I felt that my questions and what troubled me would lead me back to the Teacher again. I fell asleep with my deep thoughts. Suddenly, a loud noise woke us up. One of the Chaldean’s followers was knocking on our door. He was calling us to go with him so we could decide what to present and how.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Chaldean Commander, I personally thank you for your intervention in my rescue. I want to thank you because without you who knows where I would have ended up.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We are here and will do everything we can for the Empire and I don’t want you to doubt that. Everyone is ready to present their arguments. We’ll put an end to the debate</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">about the true nature of God. Athens is a blessed place where all the wise have passed throughout the history and on this occasion we’ll manage to show the way to inner enlightenment. I haven’t met a woman with such strength since Constantia. I’m sure that the same blood is flowing in your veins. Now please, give a presentation before me and show me how you are going to convince Flavius’s supporters so they can embrace the teachings of the brotherhood of Paul the Apostle. I will also be part of the committee, I can help you but if I insist, it’ll be obvious that I will personally benefit if your proposal is accepted. You must give the impression, which is in fact the truth, that you’re from Athens. The truth as I know it. Your plan should be how the exchange of ideas must be presented.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">It was intense, voices were raised, Constantia wanted to support them. There was a commotion, a typical scene, shouting and screeching. I felt that we wouldn’t be able to get to a result but suddenly everyone went quite. Flavius’s sister entered the room.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Chaldean, I thank you for your kind offer. You should know that I haven’t come here today to listen to you all. Tomorrow with my guests we’ll try to convince my brother to accept our proposition. Everything will be for the good of the Empire, it will bring balance and harmony and we’ll be known in history as the ones that managed to bridge the new with the old kingdom. However, only together we’ll be able to accomplish this so let’s put an end to the fighting and conflicts between us.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">These were Constantia’s words which confirmed her royal descent and what she said was exactly what would happen. Even the Chaldean was treating us as equals. It was like suddenly our presence had changed, like we had more substance, like our whole existence had changed. With that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as our compass we continued talking and we tried to come to a conclusion about how we were going to present our arguments the next day. Everything was ready for our attempt to establish the ideal Greece.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We all needed rest so after the end of the discussion we returned to our rooms. Tiredness had hit us. We lay down so we could unwind. A lot had happened the last few days.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘There were moments when I was away that I thought I’d never see you again. I thought I would stay here forever and I would follow the Emperor. I don’t know how you managed it and how no one got hurt.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My dear, we have a lot to face yet and we should consider ourselves lucky that we are together again. I don’t know who’s favoured us, it could be one of the Gods or the Fates that decide how things will unravel.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘My dear, we have to cherish this moment that</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">finds us together once again.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are absolutely right about that. We have to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">act more carefully.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘We’ll talk about that tomorrow, now kiss me…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We fell asleep in each other’s arms. Her presence</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">made me feel complete.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">That morning was different than the rest. We finally had our purpose in front of us. Everyone thought that we wouldn’t face any other obstacles. The main room, where everything was going to take place, was ready from very early. Constantia came and told us to follow her. We would attend now as her followers and so we went into the room. It was grand and decorated accordingly. It was like an emperor was going to be crowned. As time went by, the room filled up. There were representatives from all over the Empire. The representative of the bishop of Nicomedia was also there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Everyone was dressed in formal attire, which had different symbols on them that I had never come across before. On the opposite side there where representatives of the Arians. Their origins were obvious. They came from the depths of the Empire, where the greatest enemy had once emerged from. The East had to be enlightened in some way. Maybe the answer to our quest was there.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Rome had also sent her own representatives. It surely wouldn’t be easy to persuade them, we had to be prudent  so  we  could  work  through  the  conference’s challenges. We were sat at the right hand side of the Emperor. Constantia had a special place in Flavius’s heart and that was to our advantage. Constantine had not come to the palace yet. We knew from the records that he would attend. Nurihad, an Armenian follower of the Emperor, announced the beginning of the meeting. The first to speak was the representative of Nicomedia.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Dear followers of the one and only God. Christ, with his presence in this material world, only wanted to show the road to virtue. Since then many are those who act in His name. There are many Gospels now that create new directions and new dogmas which confuse the people of the world! They don’t understand why they should leave the old gods and why they have to follow the teachings of the Lord. They do nothing or they are made fanatics by the Arians, who try to destroy whatever has to do with Hellenic ideas.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The tension in the room soon built up. Cateplis, the representative of the Arians, responded with a raised voice.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The one and only Jesus Christ came to expel the demons of the old world! He has finally come! All those who doubt him should be sent to the stake!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The dispute continued…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘All those who want to embrace the nation’s gods must be considered history in my Empire! This is Flavius’s Empire and the senate will decide in the end if what is being said and proposed will stand!’ those were Nurihad’s words…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You should know Cateplis that whatever the result of the meeting is we are compelled to act for the good of the Empire, so you should watch your words and your actions. We want to bring equilibrium and not to cause more conflict. We want to bring peace. We should only have that in mind!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Everybody knows that we are going through an unsettling period and it’s not clear where it’s going to lead us. We are obliged to show the way that will bridge the old with the new. The ideas shouldn’t cancel each other but should complete one another! The future can’t exist without the past. There are two parallel worlds that must both be saved.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Constantia’s words were wise. Many that were present seemed to be taking under consideration what she said. Some others however, wanted to completely destroy the Empire. Throughout the centuries there have always been and there always will be those who for their own personal interest would destroy everything. We should probably try and find them now, in this meeting, in harder, darker times. Every enemy hides behind their clothes or their title, so it would be wise if I could discover them. Asterios and Andromache could manage without me. I spoke to Andromache who was preparing to begin her speech by referring to the words of the brotherhood of Paul the Apostle. I had a feeling that I needed to go where the Marquise was detained.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">I headed towards the exit. On the one hand, I</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">didn’t want to leave because I would be leaving Andromache</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">again but now she was under the protection of Constantia. It was the best way so she could be safe. I left having in mind her beautiful eyes. As I walked down the palace’s corridors, there were fewer guards than before. It wasn’t heavily guarded so I headed to Nicomedia. Maybe something was going on there. I had a strong feeling that was overwhelming me. I was wearing a red robe, which revealed that I belonged to the followers of Flavius’s sister. Unlike the rest of the palace, the royal quarters were well guarded. So I headed towards the part where the kidnapper of my beloved was held. When I arrived there, I asked the guards if they were certain he was inside the room where he was detained. They assured me that he was there and that a few minutes ago they gave him his meal. I had a feeling that something was going on, I couldn’t be wrong. I wandered through the corridors but I didn’t find anything, not one clue that would indicate any suspicious movements. As I went to the meeting room, two priests passed in front of me, one of them was dressed bizarrely. He was wearing something different and none of the attendees I had seen were wearing anything similar. My curiosity made me follow them. I was careful not to be seen. They were moving slowly. I realized that they were leaving the palace because they were near the exit. I was right behind them. The guards saw my red garment and nodded at me with respect. The priests were going towards the temple. There was no one there, not a guard or even another priest.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I followed them inside. As I entered I saw no movement. I was puzzled, where could they have gone? I saw a strange looking statue depicting an unknown god. I hadn’t come across anything like this before. The interior of the temple would surely fill Andromache with enthusiasm. I could probably convince her later to follow me here. I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">approached the statue. Around it there were some writings. I studied them for a while, I had seen them before but I couldn’t recall where and when. I spent quite some time examining the area around the statue. Behind the base of the statue there was a statuette, which I was certain I had seen before at the shrine of Apollo’s statue at Delphi, where Amphitriti and I had crept into the secret chamber. How could there be something similar in here. The head of the statuette looked like it was a separate part. I turned it and a passage appeared in the wall behind me. I wasn’t sure if I should go in but curiosity overtook me once more.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The torches were lit. I assumed that the priests passed through here. I continued carefully and headed to the end of the passage where steps led to another lower level. I hid behind a wall that was at the bottom of the steps. There were quite a few tables at which lots of people were sitting carefully reading scrolls. It looked like they were transcribing some writings. My curiosity grew but I had to go back to the palace. Time had passed and I wondered what had happened at the meeting. I would have to return to the secret library later that day or the next. Everything was wrapped in a veil of mystery. I was deeply puzzled when I entered the room. After a while the meeting finished and we returned to our chambers.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You were gone for quite some time, Ares. Where were you? It would have been better if you were present. I don’t know if we’ll manage to convince Nurihad. Flavius hasn’t appeared yet.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry. I won’t be missing tomorrow, I’ll be next to you during the whole meeting. I had a feeling that something was about to happen and that’s why I left. I went to make sure that the Marquise was still detained in his room, a prisoner.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You shouldn’t worry, my love. Constantia’s men</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are guarding him, there’s nothing going on.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re probably right, Andromache but we are in dark times, many of the things we are thinking might not apply. The Marquise is not an insignificant person. I’m sure that he has his own people and he can pull some strings. Even though he is a prisoner they can entice a guard by offering him a bribe. Do you not remember from our studies that it was really easy for someone to be bribed for his services?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 50pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right. A person’s vanity can consume him. It can change everything at a single moment! Empires have fallen by a simple impulsiveness.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘That’s how things are, Mache. It was that kind of</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">thinking that made me act.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You acted appropriately, my sweetheart, it’s just that sometimes I feel like you leave suddenly without a single word!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Mache, I don’t want you to feel like I’m pushing you away. All the events and the constant changes have affected me, so I sometimes go for a walk. That’s what happened the night before yesterday when the Marquise took you away from me. I had gone to clear my thoughts.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, Ares. Many things have occurred but we have been through a lot. We are lucky that we meet such important figures. We have contributed as well’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Mache, we are not just contributing but we are affecting the course of history so you must understand the weight of our actions! We might do something that we can’t undo! Besides that, our mental and physical being is in danger. That we are together again is fortunate. We won’t always be so lucky!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are  right,  my  love.  Let’s  rest  because tomorrow will be a big day. Many things await us so let’s rest…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">And so we did, while we left ourselves in the arms of Morpheus.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asterios came and interrupted my sleep.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Let’s go we have work to do…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Where are we going at this hour?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Follow me, we are going to our future so we can</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">see the result of the meeting…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘But it hasn’t finished yet!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry after today’s presentation it’ll go in our favour. I can assure you. The other representatives were somewhat  extreme  in  their  arguments,  so  with  the presentation of our writings Nurihad will be convinced and he will adopt our ideas’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How do you know all this?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I took a quick trip some years ahead but I didn’t manage to go to our era. I wanted your opinion as well on the subject, your judgment is crucial’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I appreciate that you consider my opinion</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">important but I can’t leave her by herself, I promised her!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me, Aristides, she’s stronger than you think! She will manage to convince the senate on her own. Besides I have made sure that Constantia’s guards will keep an eye on her’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know I still have my doubts’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Let’s go, I promise you nothing’s going to happen</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to her’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘How can you be so sure? I mean absolutely sure!’ ‘Listen to me, I’ve read the scriptures, I can’t tell</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you where… but it’s certain!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Alright, I trust you… I don’t know anymore what’s right and what’s wrong. I just wanted you to know Asterios that I, like you, want the good of the nation, but my love for Andromache and wanting to protect her is more important to me!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: right;">‘As I said they will protect her, nothing will happen to her! It is vitally important that we should leave together…’ ‘You should know though that if something</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happens to Andromache we’ll use the scroll for our benefit. I know that we haven’t but this time we will. I want you to know that!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Alright, Aristides, I understand but you shouldn’t worry, things are going to turn out as they should. Only our own future is uncertain’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache was sleeping heavily. I hoped that she wouldn’t notice our absence. That would surely harm our relationship but I had to go with Asterios as it would bring balance to our partnership. The truth was that my trust had been shattered during our journey. As I came out the room there were already two guards outside…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘No one shall enter here! Only when we return you’ll leave your position! Understood?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They nodded…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The orders you should know are from Flavius’s sister herself! She’ll be ruthless if for any reason you leave your post unguarded. I hope I’ve made myself clear!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes’ they both replied…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I hadn’t seen him behave this way before, he had almost a military discipline in his tone and his attitude. We went towards the stairs. The scroll appeared and we found ourselves in Athens once again.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">In Athens but not our Athens! The Acropolis was in its place but something was happening, there has been a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mistake again. As we were heading for the gate we observed that the ancient temples that once stood there had vanished and so had the Christian temples. But what could have happened? What factor could have prevailed and had negatively affected the history of our land?! There weren’t any buildings that could show the grandeur or the declining course of the city. All around were shacks. The city didn’t have much life. Only some peasants were walking around. It was as though the city was in the early stages of the Bronze Age. But the Acropolis still stood there. The Parthenon was in a better state than in our time-space continuous.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, it’s the weirdest scene we have ever encountered.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, it’s something I can’t explain… it’s like civilization has vanished from our city. We have to find someone or even some evidence that could explain what has happened.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We came across a sign that read “The City of the Banished”! What could have happened that would banish a whole city?! Could it be that the City of Light had eclipsed? The oxymoron was that the Acropolis was nearly intact. It had to become a place for the banished so that the spirit of Athens could be saved! We wandered near the theatre of Dyonisus and we found a building that was in better condition than the rest of the shacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Are you banished, wanderers?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Greetings stranger! We are visitors.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘You look like Arcadeans to me. Why are you here</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in this city?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘We’d like to know what happened.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The search for knowledge makes you one of the banished, so you were wise to come here. Only here in the whole world you’ll be able to find answers to you questions. I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">am Bythron, I am the one who will show you the way to knowledge. Others have tried to stay here but only a few could bare the light that was given to them. Knowledge burnt the shadow that was following them for generations!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How many generations have passed, for Athens to</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">become the city of the banished?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘No one can calculate that, since the damn Apostate has imposed on the Empire the beliefs of the East, since Mithras has brought division and everlasting war broke out. For centuries now these conflicts are taking place. Here, in the oasis of the banished possessing the knowledge, is the place where those who seek alternatives can find shelter. But like I told you before only a few stay. So what are you going to do? Has the revelation of the history scared you? Are you cowards, Arcadeans?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Bythron, as we explained to you from the start, we are visitors, we can’t stay long’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are traitors! Nothing more! Get out of my</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">city! Go on leave…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And so we did…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We left the city of the banished knowledge and we returned to Nicaea. We had to organize an escape plan, but it had to be done right, without putting ourselves in danger.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">On returning we found that Andromache’s guards were still there. They were waiting for us and so was Andromache still in the arms of Morpheus. Some things that were written in history were meant to remain as they are. The Apostate in both cases still remained an Apostate in history. Maybe some things never change. Maybe they should stay this way, like they were. Entering the room I lay down next to her. She was calm. So many things had happened and so many were altered but we remained there; an infinite present that was continuously alternating. From</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">one minute to the next everything could change and we would have to alter again what someone or us had mistakenly altered. What would our plan be so there would be a natural flow? This remains unknown even to us. The next day would surely bring some result.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">It was morning. The first sunrays lit the dark room of the palace. Before the meeting began we went for breakfast. There was tension in the air. The Chaldean approached us…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My fellow men, you should be happy, you’ve made a good impression on Constantia. She is thinking of sending a message to her brother personally requesting that they examine together your beliefs and your writings. It is rumored that Flavius is here in the palace and he is watching the whole meeting from a secret crypt. I’m not sure, it could only be a rumor.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘But when could this have happened? When did he arrive? Shouldn’t we have seen him?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You have many questions Andromache and I have</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">no right answers.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Quick, quick… your room is on fire!’ ‘What? How?’ the Chaldean said…</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Not your room, my lord, your followers’!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Damned shall be he who did something like this!</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">How is it possible for something like this to happen?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘I don’t know, my lord, you’d better go and see what’s going on’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Hurry, my fellow men…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">When we arrived at the room the fire was already under control but everything in the room was burnt’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘How did this happen? Where the guards there?’ ‘No, they had left’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Why weren’t they here?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘They had to leave, my lord!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why did they leave? They were strictly ordered to stay here!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘My lord, the Marquise managed to escape!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How? Who was such an idiot to let him out? This Empire is full of traitors!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘My lord, they say that he set the fire!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">When Constantia heard all this she came down to see what had happened. She was stunned with everything that had occurred.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Who is responsible for this act?’ ‘The Marquise, my lady!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Arrest him at once and question him, without a trial and with no jury! And confiscate all his fortune from his family! What happened to the gospels of Paul the Apostle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Unfortunately, my lady, there were in the room!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘So we’ve lost our advantage to support your brotherhood with evidence. It’d be best for you now if you left this place. I don’t know if I can keep you under my protection from now on. Without the manuscripts from Paul the Apostle you won’t be safe with me. I promise you that the traitor will be punished!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">We looked at one other and we left…maybe we were lucky maybe we weren’t…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How could all this happen? We tried our best. We might have succeeded in our goal.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re right, Andromache, lets return to our era.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We’ll explain everything to you, don’t worry’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Athens looked like a foreign city. We’ve seen it different so many times now…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><table border="0"

Many things had happened and many things could have turned out differently. We were lucky that we all came out unharmed. Andromache however, was the one that had the most traumatic experience. I believe that she would be reluctant about our next journey. Will there be another trip or would we remain trapped in our bleak reality? Maybe we should go to another place of the timehistory. Maybe we should stay here. So many questions without clear answers.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The days went by and no one mentioned at the table our journey. Asterios, for some weird reason, hadn’t left the house at all. He hadn’t gone on his usual sudden trips. It was like he had lost his way. He stays in his room meditating. The stars hadn’t changed positions. After a long time I wanted to enjoy some of the simple things that life has to offer us. A nice simple Greek coffee. Away from the political jabbering, away from the betrayals of the nation and away from the invisible asymmetrical threats that can’t be controlled or overcome. As an observer of time I watched the passersby of Athens. After a while Andromache came and sat next to me…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where are we going? From one Emperor to the next… or are we going to stay with our hands crossed, here, where we belong?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can you be so sure Andromache that we belong here? We may have been born here but our souls could belong someplace else. We should have grown up in another era, not now…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What can I say Ares. It could be that our souls are looking for the ideal place to rest.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And what place would that be?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘The ideal place would be the one where every citizen could be free, where equality and uniqueness would be totally respected.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And you believe that something like this is</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">possible?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘It has to be Ares, that’s our purpose. That’s where</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">we have to go.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘And where is our next destination then?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What would you think about becoming a crusader</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the Pope?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Alexios II was close to a camp of those coming from the west. It was the best position to organize the attack on the gate. We had arrived a little earlier but the Crusaders couldn’t be far. We just had to be in the correct position so we can put our plan into action. And so we did. We headed towards a village that was nearby, the peasants were friendly enough but scared. They treated us with suspicion. They probably thought that we were with the mercenaries, who should be arriving by the next nightfall with the first army. We explained to them that we didn’t have hostile intentions and we just wanted to make our presence as discreet as possible. We were informed that there was a small inn just outside the village, which was occasionally used by visitors who wanted to spend the night before they entered the City.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nightfall had come so we went to our rooms. Tomorrow we had many things to do. When the crusaders would arrive at that point, we had to be prepared to blend in with the crowd so we could find the right position to carry out our plan. It wasn’t an easy task. It was probably the most dangerous of everything we had ever tried but it had to be done. So we rested. Morpheus made his presence known once more. Maybe he wanted to teach me some things or wanted to warn me about the things that were about to happen, but the message wasn’t clear. It was hard for me to decipher my subconscious and the messages it was sending me. Things would soon clear. The Fates had chosen the path. It’s a reality that we don’t want to compromise with, the events that are about to take place will be important for our personal growth. I have a strong feeling about this. We must be especially careful about how we are going to handle things. Here we don’t know who our allies are or who our enemies are. It’s a time were everything and everyone can be bought. The mercenary army of the Crusaders could be influenced. It could be bought. They are susceptible and money lovers like the Byzantines. I fell asleep with my thoughts.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We ate our breakfast; the owner of the inn was</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">very kind…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where are you from? I know it not my place to ask but you don’t look like locals. Many have stayed here but I can’t tell where you are from. I’m just curious I don’t want to pry…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We come from Thessaloniki. We want to become part of the effort for the union of the two churches. It’s a difficult task but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try. Certainly the endeavor is mandatory, it’s the ethical thing to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">do, it’s just that we shouldn’t trust Innocendios, his</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">intensions aren’t clear.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I can tell that you love your land, for you to have travelled so far. I can give you some advice, go and find Timotheus…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Who is Timotheus?’ Andromache asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘My dear lady, he is a member of the royal guard. His goal is to recruit as many capable soldiers that are loyal to the Empire. When you find him tell him that Filonicus sent you. He is in the camp that has been set up outside the palace. Go now before the representatives of Rome come…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">So with Filonicus’s encouragement we went to find Timotheus…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios was concerned that we had trusted a complete stranger. He could be right but we had no other choice. If something better came up we would consider it. So I followed the omens. Before we left the inn an eagle was flying high above the camp where Timotheus was. When we arrived we encountered many soldiers from different parts of the world. Everyone had joined for different purposes. Many had a submissive look while others had the look of a fortune hunter. There were also many soldiers who had the signs of war  imprinted  on  their  faces.  Those  were  the  most courageous and ruthless of all. Alexios was counting on them for victory.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">We walked to the main tent. One of the guards</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">approached us aggressively…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Who are you and why have you got a woman with you? Bring her here so general Filonicus can see her!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">He came close and went to grab Andromache. We certainly didn’t expect this reaction. Filonicus had said that Timotheus was friendly towards the supporters of the union. I couldn’t understand this. The guard drew his sword in a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">threatening way. Andromache soon realized what would follow and with her wounds still fresh, drew my sword and thrust it through the guard’s stomach. There was blood everywhere.  Her  reaction  left  us  speechless.  Asterios especially froze. We had caused a commotion and soldiers gathered around us with threatening intentions.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Clear the way, move you ignorant…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">You could hear voices. There was obviously someone superior coming…</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Whoever wants can confront the woman alone…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The man speaking was Timotheus.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are all idiots. Do you think that because she’s a woman you can manipulate her as you wish?! Achaeans are strong people! Leave them alone! They are under my protection! Follow me to my tent’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">And we did without a second thought.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we were walking to Timotheus’s tent everyone around kept staring at us like they were threatened by our presence, but they didn’t have hostile intentions. The only thing we wanted was to contribute to the cause of the union. The only thing we wanted with all our heart was the union. We were coming from very far, we had come a long way and no one knew where we would end up. I felt like the universe was conspiring but I didn’t know if it was for our benefit or not. And Timotheos’s sudden appearance? He appeared too easy. The veil of mystery that covers everything is troubling me. I feel more insecure now than in all the previous journeys we had gone on. Asterios seems indifferent, he’s not speaking, just following. He never said much but he always took initiative. Now suddenly he’s silent and that is the mystery during our course that he never remained indifferent to the development of the events. Whatever the case, we had to be careful, we are a team.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Timotheus greeted us warmly in his tent. His intentions were honest towards us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Since Filonicus sent you, I welcome you with open arms. He is my one of my men. He is my eyes and ears outside these walls. He didn’t send you to me by accident. I know that you come from central Greece, it shows that you are Achaeans…</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can you tell my lord?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘From the way you walk and talk. You have a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">gentle demeanour.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘And you my lady, you are quite capable with the sword. Local women haven’t got you dexterity.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Why? He didn’t know us! I’d try and look at it as objectively as possible. I shouldn’t be suspicious of him maybe he wanted to help us as it finally turned out…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">He suggested that we should stay in a tent near his own. At nightfall, one of the informers approached telling them that tomorrow the Crusaders would arrive, so we still had a night to rest and to sleep on the situation and the events that were about to unravel around us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Asterios, why have you become an observer of the events? Usually we all act together. What happened and you’ve changed your attitude?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Andromache, a lot has happened and I usually have a feeling about what is going to happen but coming here it’s like an obstacle has appeared in front of me. It’s like everything that I’ve been trained to do has no value.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘And where did you train?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I can’t reveal this to you yet. It’s something that I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">will gradually tell you with time.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘If we live to tell our story…’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course you’ll live! Don’t worry, you’ll be close</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to me.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Timotheus had arrived, he wanted to assure us that</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">everything would be fine…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are under my protection. No one can hurt you! We’ll proceed together. You should always be near me whatever the case and don’t let anyone near you. When the Crusaders arrive we have to be even more cautious. Never trust the people from the west. At least we are fighting for a holy cause, for our nation. They, on the other hand, are fighting for money and they don’t care about anyone. It’s all about money and power. We must put an end to all this selfish behaviour.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are talking strangely, Timotheus.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 50pt;text-align: justify;">‘I speak this way because I have seen plenty, Andromache. And there is still more to come. No one is who they seem and we are all pretending to be someone we’re not. The continuous flow of events is what makes us adapt all the time. Everything is in a continuous flow that’s why we have to be well prepared. So enough for tonight, I’ll go back to my tent because tomorrow no one knows what might happen.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">out!</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘The Crusaders are coming!’ a messenger called</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It  was  morning.  Pope  Innocendios  was  an</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ambiguous personality. It still remained a mystery how he accepted to help with the re-establishment of the throne. It could be that the East always captivated the Westerners. It had a magic that up to a point the Greeks could understand, even embrace it, although it was wrong. It was something foreign for us. It corrupted the Greeks and seduced them. As happened  with  Alexander  the  Great.  The  mystery  of something foreign, which like a siren calls you and leads you</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to mysterious paths. It seduces you. For the western people it’s something so distant, which made them centuries later, try and conquer pieces of land in the Eastern continent. So the fourth crusade was one of the most painful and bloody moments in the history of the nation. Let’s hope that things won’t get worst.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The presence of Alexios II was a prerequisite for the army. Maybe he was afraid of his life, when someone else wins the battle, they always take the glory. Our work and our effort for the good of the nation; who is going to recognize it?</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The arrogance that overwhelmed me had to be extinguished; But how? One of Timotheus’s followers was sent to fetch us. So we followed him and shortly all three of us were in his tent. We dressed in the appropriate outfits and waited for the leader of the Crusaders to come. We expected someone older but he wasn’t some great general with war scars, he was young and with a bizarre looking outfit. He seemed familiar.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">He  introduced  himself  as  Domenicus.  His characteristics were Frankish but it was known to us that throughout the Italian domain the Greek element was prominent for centuries. He might have been aware of it or not. We had to be cautious as Timotheus said before. We didn’t have time to lose.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We have to gather the Forces quickly under my command and vanquish the bastard king Isakios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen young man, if you are here to help restore the balance it will be done under my command.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘But I’m a representative of the Catholic Church’. ‘You might be the most respective person in your</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">land but here things are different. Your contribution will be</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">helpful but you won’t lead anything. If you want to be at the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">front of the battle that’s fine but I won’t allow your soldiers</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to restrict my army. I hope I’ve made myself clear.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Timotheus’s speech was strong. The young soldier understood his position and we also knew that we had to follow his advice to the letter. The plan of how to conquer the city had been ready for days now. If it was carefully executed we wouldn’t encounter any resistance from the apostates of Isaacus. He explained to us that he had someone he trusted who wouldn’t change his beliefs. Without him the plan could not be carried out. He still hadn’t revealed to us how we would accomplish it. He sent Domenicus’s battalion to the central gate of the palace. The royal horns sounded and the battle began. The first arrows were shot from the corner towers. Fortunately, there weren’t many casualties. The catapults began launching stones that were on fire, which were covered in the liquid from Hades and which set fire to the wooden door. In order not to burn, they lowered it but they were trapped like rats. So the army of the bastard king began moving forward. The Latins  were  retreating  slowly  but  still  held.  Suddenly, Timotheus ordered us to head east of the wall.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Trust me Achaean, our plan is going well.’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">His words were reassuring but didn’t have the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">expected result. He was right that we could get in.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where are you leading us?’ Asterios asked</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘He inherited your distrust’ Timotheus replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you talking about?’ my friend asked</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">puzzled.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I hadn’t time to pay attention to what he said. We</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">were parallel to the wall when suddenly a door opened.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Follow me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">The order was heard from the depths of the forest where the battalion was hidden. We were finally inside the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">walls. We had entered from the only door, from where Porthitis had entered. But my thoughts and everything that was happening couldn’t let me see the oxymoron of the situation.  Soon  Isaacus’s  army  was  surrounded.  They surrendered. Now we had to find him and put him on trial. When we arrived at the throne room he wasn’t there.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘He has escaped. We’ll find him, don’t worry. People will hear that he’s a coward and will turn him in’ Timotheus said ‘Give out the order, he is outlawed, the reward will be high.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The news spread quickly throughout the nation. Alexios II appeared in the room where he once sat proudly like a true descendant of the Comnenus. The time had come for their payment.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where’s the gold you promised us for re-establishing</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the true Emperor?’ Dominicus said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry. We going to do everything we promised you.’ Timotheus replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Timotheus, Andromache, Aristides, Dominicus and I went to the treasure room but we knew it’d be empty. Isaacus had already left with the treasure. When Dominicus faced the empty room he drew his sword and so did we.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You tricked me, I’ll kill you all’ he said</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Calm down young man, I’ll take you to the real treasure, don’t worry. Isaacus only took a small part of it, I know were the rest is hidden, it’s in a crypt. You’ll get what we promised you’ Timotheus said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We followed him to a place, where the walls were covered with the portraits of all the Emperors of Byzantium. Behind the portrait of Ioustinianos there was a small crypt. Timotheus put his hand inside and a crack appeared in the wall. He went inside and we followed him. He led us into a room full of gold.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So Latin, half of the gold is yours. Load it and go back to Innokentios and establish the union. I’ll send someone to oversee, as you could take the whole treasure and leave. We have to prepare the crowning ceremony of Alexios.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Those were Timotheus’s words and he left and we followed. We were lucky. The battle was won easier than I had expected.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘If you want to stay, you more than welcome.’ ‘Yes, we will’ Asterios exclaimed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">Timotheus replied with a smile. During the battle he was quiet like we all were.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Good, go and wash up and come to find me and I’ll tell you what we’ll do.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">The corridors in the palace were majestic, grandeur everywhere. We hadn’t time to see the throne room.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘I bet it’s truly magnificent’ Andromache said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I think we’ll have the chance, don’t worry. We might have succeeded in what we came for. Later on we can all go together to see the results of our actions.’ I replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Achaeans, Achaeans, come quick to the treasure room. They are asking for you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We quickly followed the soldier. On arrival we saw Timotheus and Dominicus ready to fight.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened? Calm down’ I told them.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Calm down? The treasure is fake. You are betraying</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">us again.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you talking about? We’ve nothing to do with what you’re accusing us’ I told him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You betrayed me, the nation and Amphitriti. I’ll make sure it won’t happen again’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Who did you say I betrayed?’ ‘Amphitriti, my mother.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘He drew his sword and ran towards me. I defended myself. The guards were ready to intervene but Timotheus ordered them to stay put.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are going to die traitor’ he exclaimed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">He was full of rage. Those were the last words the rest heard him utter. My sword pierced his abdomen. My hands were covered in blood. As he was letting out his last breath he whispered to me,</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m dying from my father’s sword.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">My whole world crashed. What had happened? Andromache froze. Asterios wasn’t there. Only Timotheus was ready to act.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Get up. We are done here.’ Timotheus said.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you saying? How can we have finished</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">here?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Follow me or you’ll all die here’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: justify;">Timotheus’s guards protected us. We ran to the throne chamber. Behind the throne stood a pair of two-headed eagles. He turned the claw of one of the eagles and an underground crypt appeared. We went down and he ordered his guards to go to the main gate. He needed them there.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Timotheus, we can’t leave Asterios behind.’ ‘Don’t worry he is safe.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘And how do you know? I can’t trust you’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘We don’t have a choice, my love, we don’t know anyone else here.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">He had saved us and we had no other choice. Her words were wise. I couldn’t think clearly. So many things had happened in such a short time.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We followed our saviour. With torches in our hands we walked slowly through the underground crypt.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where are you taking us, Timotheus?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘At the end of the tunnel Filonicus is waiting for us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don’t worry I’ll explain everything to you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">What he said was true. Filonicus opened a hatch and we surfaced.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘We all have to calm down and move away from here. The events that follow don’t favour our presence here. We have to go to the era where you came from’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you talking about? How do you know so many things about us and about our time? You are absolutely right about us leaving but I don’t think your name is Timotheus. And where is Asterios?’ Andromache asked him inquisitively.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry. He is in the right place in time but you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">won’t see him for quite a while.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you saying? How do I know that he is alive and that his body is not lying somewhere in the palace.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides will give you all the answers, but not here, because if we stay here you neither going to see Asterios again nor your house in Athens. Don’t ask how I know this I just know…’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">He was right. That was going to be my next question. He took a scroll out similar to ours and began reading. After an eight century journey we found ourselves in our house again. With us was the leader of the guards.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘But where did you find a scroll similar to the one Asterios had?’ I asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I wrote them, Aristides, as well as the one you</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">possess. I gave it you in Thebes’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘What? You have the same scroll and you didn’t tell me? How could you hide this from me?’ her words sounded like burning iron, she was furious with me, ‘We’ve been through all this together, you almost lost me and you hid from me the fact that you had a scroll as well!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Don’t be mad Andromache. Everything happened according to my plan.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘And what’s your plan, Timotheus?’ she asked</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">infuriated.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He touched her on the top of her head and she suddenly calmed down.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘In the name of God, who are you? You write scrolls, you intervene in our lives and you change the course of the nation. Who gives you the right?’ she said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, everything is as you said. You should know though that I’m the Founder of the nation with the only purpose of keeping the spirit and the light of the Greeks alive forever.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you mean you are the Founder? I don’t understand’ Andromache responded puzzled.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am the first Greek. Deukalionas, son of Zeus. I am</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">here to restore the balance.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">His words seemed unreal, like the whole journey up to now.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You speak the truth Deukalionas, but how are we</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">going to live here?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’ll be with you the next few days. The founding stone is where it belongs now but much has to be done yet. Don’t worry because while I’m beside you, time will not touch you’ the Founder said.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where is Asterios? Is he alright?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘He’s fine but in a different point in time in history. He is well trained. You’ll meet again’ and he turned to talk to me ‘Aristides, you have to go back and explain to Amphitriti what happened. Beware of the calling of the Siren!’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you mean Deukaliona?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘When the time comes you’ll know. Go now and I’ll stay with Andromache.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Maybe she should come with me’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, Aristides, you have to go alone’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">His words were wise and true. I had to go and tell her. So I took one more trip through time space which was probably the last.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The garden was lush! The mountain behind the Oracle’s temple was filled with blossoms. It was one of the prettiest places in the whole domain. I walked for quite a while round the temple, but there weren’t many people. When I arrived at the theatre there was a woman sitting resembling Amphitriti. She approached me.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you seeking stranger on a day like this? Everyone is at Itea celebrating the victory against the enemy of the East’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why aren’t you celebrating?’ I responded.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘My son, for a long time now, cannot be seen by the eye of Phoebus. I don’t know where he is.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know, though, where he is Amphitriti!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">She froze.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How do you know my name?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘This is how you introduced yourself many years ago’. ‘Aristides? Is that you? Time has been kind to you.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You look exactly the same the day I met you. I didn’t expect to see you again’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know. Neither did I, Amphitriti!’ ‘Our son has gone to find you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘How did he know where I was, Amphitriti? Only the Oracle could know this but he would never ask Phoebus for a prophecy. He could never be that selfish.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I haven’t been honest with you, Aristides. Amphitriti was my name before I took my position in the Temple. I gave the prophecies.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I felt strange.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You should have told me the truth, I wouldn’t have let myself come so close.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why? Have you regretted it, Aristides?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, not at all, but I would have acted differently.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why did you act this way?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘The life of an Oracle was unbearable. I couldn’t live like that any longer and when I met you for the first time, I was swept away… but that means that the prophecy came true in order for you to be here.’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Unfortunately, I bring you bad news, Oracle’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where has the misfortune took place, Aristides?’ ‘Far away from here, Amphitriti, in another era’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I won’t see him again?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘No, you won’t see him again and I have to go back to where I belong. I owed it to you to tell you everything that has happened’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hug me for one last time’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">She whispered something in my ear. My desire to leave was fading slowly. I recalled the words of the Founder,</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Watch the words of the siren’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">She wanted to keep me near her but I kept pushing her away.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Your calling can’t keep me here, Oracle. Your actions got you where you are, alone, with no husband and no child. Farewell’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">I had to return to my time.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I found everything as I’d left it.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Deukalionas  stayed  with  us  for  a  while.  He introduced  us  to  mysticism  and  to  the  spiritual communication  with  the  Maker.  He  came  and  went depending on his time. He was always there though, helping us with new battles as well as with the spread of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">philosophy. The moment had come for our plan to be realized.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Father, I’m leaving. I’ll see you again at Marathon and at Isida’s sarcophagus’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Goodbye, Asterios, my child’ Andromache said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><img width="72" height="20" src="data:image/png;base64,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"/></td></tr></table></span></p></body></html>
