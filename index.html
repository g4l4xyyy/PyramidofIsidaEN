It is said that cut backs should be</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">made; that at this moment in time emphasis should be given to the country’s present day and leave the past to its destiny. Without the past there is no future. Whoever doesn’t possess the knowledge of his heritage is doomed to have limited  awareness  of  oneself.  This  land  has  offered everything from the very beginning of our history, arts, poetry and philosophy. Indeed, if someone stops to analyze what has been created they will probably never finish. You’ll be lost in this mythical history. Sometimes you discover a paradox. From time to time with some of my colleagues we have disputes about various subjects concerning some archaeological artifacts. Lately, we have been talking a lot about the pyramids that are located within the Greek domain. A lot has been said but for some reason there has been no in-depth study; nor any academic research. It’s very strange if someone considers the severity of the subject.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">There has been great interest in the fact that in the area of Marathon there is an archaeological site that is dedicated to Isida. The myth mentions that Herodes Atticus, after a trip to Egypt, decided that he should build a pyramid in honor of the goddess. It is very interesting indeed and it has intrigued me for quite a while now. I have to find the truth though; to get funding for research or for some other excavation, in theory, is impossible. Only to think about the bureaucracy of a government department, in order for the Academy to hold a meeting, they get tired just thinking about having to deal with something new. I posed the idea to my colleague Andromache.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides’ she said ‘I believe that it’s a wonderful idea to attempt something like that. I will stand by you with all my powers’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Her support was very important to me. Without her help it could not be realized. After a lot of thought we decided to go ahead with the venture.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We put it forward as a request at the Academy’s meeting. We waited with anticipation for the decision. The night before the decision was made a strange presence came to me in my sleep. The morning I went to the Academy’s offices I had a strange feeling concerning the decision which we long awaited. Arriving, I saw the disappointment in Andromache’s face.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘I see. Tell me how many were in favour and how</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">many against’, I asked her.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Fourteen were in favour and sixteen against’ she</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Okay, don’t worry, the fact that we managed to get</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so many votes in favour is an achievement in itself’ I continued saying to her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">After a while Mr. Apostolopoulos, who was a member of the Academy and the uncle of my colleague, came by.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, Aristides’ he said to me. ‘Hello, Nicolas’ I said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘For  the  first  time  the  Academy  nearly  gave permission for an excavation. For me it’s a success that the matter has even been set for discussion. Usually they mock it. They mostly act this way because they are afraid that something new might be discovered and ripple the waters. Even though I am one of the newest members of the Academy, I have seen many things happening during my life. The fact that you have got so many votes is remarkable and it will surely cause a stir. You have to know that the matter is not over yet. It might attract some publicity and this will be to your benefit’. This was what Mr. Apostolopoulos said to us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">I don’t know why he told us all this but it seems like there is an underlying promise to what he said. Andromache though reacted differently. She began to utter words that I had never heard her say before. I approached her and I tried to calm her down. All this experience had brought us closer. There was a mutual respect and I thought highly of her; but much more was present as well. Because of the work load though, I hadn’t managed to approach her; but we both knew how we felt. So, I took the first step. I hugged her. Our feelings were perplexing. She shed a tear and I kissed her. There were tears of joy and sadness. What happened was so oxymoron! It took a small tragedy to bring us together. For now we returned to our positions. From now on we would claim Isida as a couple.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The days at the University during the summer months were quiet. Winter and spring had passed since the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">day of the decision. Her uncle’s words had come true up to a point. In the Academy there was a small disturbance. Some of the newspapers got involved with our matter. However, whatever gets a lot of publicity quickly, is forgotten just as quick. The same thing happened to us. After a small personal presentation, we continued with our mortal lives… It’s the eve of august the fifteenth and the city is empty. Nothing hardly moves in Greece during these days. Most of the people are going to be at some beach or on some island so they can get away from the tiresome routine. We all live in a tiresome way whether we admit it or not. That morning I received  an  email.  It  was  someone  named  Asterios Avgerinos. It only contained a phone number. A strange email. I was curious. So I decided to call him.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good morning, could I speak to Mr. Avgerinos?’ ‘It’s me. Who’s speaking?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m Aristides Pensilis. I’ve just read the email that you sent me. It’s hard for me to understand what you want from me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘It’d be best Aristides if we could talk face to face’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course, do you want to meet at the Book Arcade</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">at five o’clock this evening?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">He agreed. I was curious to find out what this gentleman wanted. The message he had sent to me was only a few words. Tomb, Persians and Isis. Words that for someone else might not mean anything but in my case they meant everything. So I went to the meeting point without knowing who I was going to encounter. He might not even show up. Could it be just a prank? I wanted to confide in Andromache but she would probably be against it and she would probably be right. I ordered a coffee and waited. It wasn’t long before the one who invited me showed up.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening Aristides!’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening Asterios! Forgive me for being so informal, but with people I know…’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you mean? I don’t know you’. ‘Don’t take any notice of me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, the three words you sent me, someone could have considered them as enigmatic; but how did you know exactly what to send me so you would catch my attention and I would find myself here with you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right. Nevermind that, let’s get down to our business’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Which is?’ I said to him.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘The pyramid of Isida in Marathon of course’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And what do you know about this matter Mr.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Avgerinos?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘A few months ago the subject had quite some</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">publicity, right?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Correct, but what’s your interest in this particular</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">matter?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I’m here to help you Aristides’ ‘And how can you do that?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me carefully’ he told me ‘Since it was brought to my attention I searched and found some people that could help me and I, in my turn, could help you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">I continued by telling him, ‘Thank you for your interest Asterios but the matter was presented to the Academy and they rejected it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know the whole story; you don’t have to tell me but this belongs in the past. Things will take a different turn. So I have to be able to inform you regularly about what has to be done, so I’ll need your personal phone number. We’ll meet regularly. That’s all for now’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, Asterios, I’ll wait for you to call me. Until next</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">time’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That’s what he told me and left.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">It was truly a bizarre experience. I didn’t think he was joking. He wouldn’t have gone to so much trouble. I arrived home thinking about everything that had happened. I had to share it with Andromache. We began this matter together, which now seems to be growing in proportion beyond anything we could have comprehended. I would tell her when I saw her in the evening…</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We met in Plaka.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening, honey’. ‘Good evening!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">She kissed me sweetly and sat next to me. We had gone to a tavern. We ordered something light to eat since it was summer. During dinner I hardly spoke because I was preoccupied with what had happened earlier.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, from the moment we arrived you haven’t said much. All the time I’ve known you, I’ve never seen you so quiet. What’s wrong?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen, my love, what I’m about to tell you might seem a bit odd, but I want you to listen to me carefully’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Of course!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, today I had a meeting with a man, Mr. Avgerinos, who promises that he can help us with the Isida’s case’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can he help us? I can’t understand since we haven’t got the approval from the Academy. It’s not possible’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘I told him exactly the same thing, sweetheart. He</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">claims that he has a way to overcome these processes’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Do you think that he’s joking, honey? Do you think he  just  wants  us  to  become  the  laughing  stock  of archaeology?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Mache, I have thought of all that myself, but I don’t</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">think he would go to so much trouble to get involved with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">this issue if he wasn’t serious. Either way we’ve got nothing to lose. For now let’s keep this matter between us. Don’t say anything to your uncle. At least until the process has started. If the excavations start, then you can go ahead and tell him’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, my love, you know that I’m trustworthy’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Could something good come out from all of this? I’ll</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">wait and see what the Fates will bring’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache agreed with me as well. A few days went by. Still, this was concerning me more and more; but nothing.  Avgerinos  hadn’t  contacted  me  yet.  I  wasn’t disappointed. I had nothing to lose. However, curiosity is like a virus that eats away at you. So, I decided to go and visit the archaeological site. Of course the time when I arrived it was closed and so I was forced to observe it from the outside. I was tempted to force the lock, but for some obscure reason there were cameras that surveyed the site constantly. Six months ago this wouldn’t have been the case. I was perplexed. It seemed like the Academy was afraid of something. That’s why it had placed surveillance cameras. There was no fear of me entering, even though I wanted to a lot, but for ethical reasons I didn’t. However, the CCTV was more than enough to show me that this change was not a coincidence. Hence, I’ll wait for Mr. Avgerinos’s phone call. Arriving at the house my partner was waiting for me.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Is everything okay, my love?’ ‘Yes, Mache’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Are you sure?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I said yes. Why so inquisitive?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Aristides, lately you have been distant. It’s like you’re hiding something from me’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘You know only too well that I’m not hiding anything</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from you. On the contrary, I’m being very honest. Whatever’s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happening you know about. Wherever I go and whatever I</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">do, I tell you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Okay, where were you now, Ares? Why did you leave your mobile at home? You haven’t done that before. Also, there was an unknown number calling you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me, Andromache, it happens. All of us have forgotten their mobile from time to time. I don’t want anything to come between us because there is no reason’ I said to her.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re right. Sometimes I go too far. I will settle with</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">what you told me’ she replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You don’t have to be apologetic Andromache, it’s just that all this insecurity took me by surprise’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’ll be honest with you, Ares. My uncle, for some reason, told me to be careful because you are not being candid with me!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 38pt;text-align: justify;">‘You’re uncle’s words are strange. Why would he turn round and express such an opinion of me? And what did you answer him, my love?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘My reply came from my heart. I told him that you’d tell me everything and that you’re not hiding anything. I believe I gave him the correct answer’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I’m just having some thoughts that are confusing me and I don’t know if we should continue this matter together’ I replied.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I know though, Aristides; we began this together and we will end it together. We are not going to take separate roads. Isida is the one that brought us together’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right, Mache, but there might be dangerous situations ahead. We’re in this together!’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">After the intense conversation we had, we ate under the August moon. It was a full moon. A magical night. Although something would disrupt these tranquil waters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Good evening!’ I answered the phone.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, Aristides, it’s me Asterios Avgerinos!’ ‘Hello, Asterios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, tomorrow we have to meet. This time you should bring Andromache as well. I have to inform you both about what is going to happen. Tomorrow we’ll meet at the same place we’d met the previous time’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘Okay’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We agreed. I explained everything to Andromache. She agreed to come. I tried to find some information about him, but nothing. I only found a picture on a webpage of a baby, who bore the same name. So, it remains unknown who he is and where he comes from. The veil over the mystery would remain for some time yet. At the University we had to prepare for the coming exam period. The next morning we gave our attention to the lessons and to the curriculum we had to teach during the year. The time passed quietly by getting a lot of work done and fulfilling our obligations. In the evening, just before we were ready to leave the university, Andromache’s uncle informed us that he had summoned an urgent meeting for the professors. We, however, had to find a way to avoid it because we were going to meet Mr. Avgerinos. There has never been an unscheduled meeting before. She managed to find a way to excuse our absence. She told her uncle that we had to go the gynecologist and that she couldn’t cancel the appointment. A woman can engineer many things when needed. It’s one side of their amazing nature!</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">As we arrived at the Book Arcade, a feeling of awe overcame me, as usual. Asterios was already there. He approached us and we began to walk towards Panepistimiou Ave. As we were walking, for some reason he wasn’t speaking to us, he just told us to follow him. We got close to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the area near the Acropolis, he told us that we could talk freely now.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Why?’ I asked him ‘What kept us all this time from</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">expressing our thoughts?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘It could be, dear Aristides, that they might be watching us. Near the Acropolis we are safe’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can you say that with such certainty?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘You can either trust me or not. This is my only</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">condition for this matter to proceed’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Alright, we will follow you in this, Mr. Avgerinos’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We sat somewhere near the sacred rock of the Acropolis.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Aristides, Andromache, from tomorrow we will begin the excavation in Marathon’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Mr. Avgerinos, could I ask you how this is feasible since we tried to get permission but it was impossible to go on with our plans’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘You don’t have to worry because the permission comes directly from the president of the Greek republic. No one is going to bother us’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘How is it possible to get this kind of license?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘All your questions will be answered in due time’ he</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I continued… ‘There are some bureaucratic issues</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">that must be resolved such as our positions in the University’. ‘You shouldn’t worry about that because as of</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tomorrow substitute professors will be assigned’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘How  is  this  possible,  Mr.  Avgerinos?’  Mache exclaimed. ‘My uncle, Nikos Apostolopoulos, is never going to consent to something like that’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘He will not put up a fight. You should know, Andromache,  that  whatever  we  act  upon  has  been predefined. The orders come from above. You can’t imagine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So, tomorrow I’m going to be at Marathon around eight in the morning. You should also come around this time. That’s it for now. Take care!’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">So, we went our separate ways.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We continued with Andromache to go to a tavern in Plaka.
